        <h1>Tekken 3 - SLUS-00402</h1><h2>NOTE2</h2>With this code, it replaces your character's motion capture with another character's. In other words, this allows you to use another character's moves. This way, you can play, for example, Xiaoyu with Ogre's moves. Replace the two "xx"s in the codes below with the number corresponding to the character's moves you'd like to have. Both "xx"s must have the same number in them. The list of numerals corresponding to the moves can be found here. With this code active, every character you choose will play like the character whose moves you've selected.This code has some drawbacks. These are: 1.) If you Continue in Arcade Mode, your character will revert back to his or her normal moves. As soon as you reach the next stage, however, they will change back to what you've chosen via the code. 2.) If you play more than one match in VS Mode, your moves will revert back to normal. To fix this, simply Soft Reset (Select+Start) after each match you play in VS Mode, then go back into VS Mode. 3.) Sometimes you cannot play against the character whose moves you're using. Example: If you've selected Jin, and the code's given you Eddy's moves, if you fight against Eddy the game may occasionally crash. Usually it doesn't, so you can take the risk.<h2>MOTION</h2>

$14 Force Mode Enemies' Moves<h2>NOTE3</h2>3.) At the character select screen, Press Select+Square to choose Crow, Press Select+X to choose Falcon, Press Select+Triangle to choose Hawk, Press Select+Circle to choose Owl. This code comes in three sets. Input all three sets exactly as they appear here, with each in their own code slot. Make sure all three sets are active when you use this code. The Force Mode enemies' move set is somewhat pathetic. They can't jump, can't duck, and can only dash, not walk. They have painfully few moves as well, so I recommend replacing their moves with the code below, "Replace Force Mode Enemies' Moves With Better Ones." If you do decide to keep the Force Mode enemies' original moves, remember this astonishingly simple 75% damage combo: Down-towards + RP , Down-towards + RP, Down-towards + RP. Important Notes: Don't select "Command" from the Pause menu when playing one of the Force Mode enemies. If you do, the game may crash. This code does not work with Force Mode. If you enter Force Mode with this code active the game will crash. Use the code below to play as Crow, Falcon, Hawk and Owl in Force Mode. Play as the Force Mode enemies IN Force Mode.<h2>NOTE5</h2>The Force Mode enemies' moves are pretty poor. With this code, you can replace them with those of any other character. Replace both "xx"s with the same number. Pick them from this list. This code has the same drawbacks as the Motion Capture Change code, which you can read about above.<h2>NOTE12</h2>With this code, nope, I'm not telling you what this code does. You'll have to see for yourself. Be sure to enter each set (there are three) in its own code slot in the exact order they appear here, and make sure all three are ON when you start the game. One mistake could cause the whole code to not work, so be careful! Also, don't expect too much with this code... it's just for fun. And don't worry, you should be able to see what effect it has instantly! Note that you must have everything unlocked to use this code. If you don't, nothing will happen. Make sure you load a saved game with everything unlocked or have the "Absolutely Everything Unlocked" code active at the same time.<h2>N Joker Command</h2><samp>D00ABA60 ????</code><br><h2>Infinite Health P1</h2><samp>300A961E 008C</code><br><h2>Infinite Health P2</h2><samp>300AAEAA 008C</code><br><h2>Absolutely Everything Unlocked</h2><samp>80097EF0 FFFF<br>30097EF2 001F<br>80097EF4 0382<br>30097EF6 0005<br>80097EF8 FFFF<br>30097EFA 001F<br>30097EFD 0009<br>30097EFE 0001<br>80097F26 0101</code><br>With this code, you get, all 22 characters, including Tiger. All secret costumes (press "Start" to select them - the characters that have them are Jin, Eddy, Law, Xiaoyu, Anna, and Gun Jack), Tekken Ball Mode, Theater Mode with all endings, including Gun Jack's good ending. And uou can save this stuff to Memory Card when the code is active, by the way.<h2>Motion Capture Change - P1's Motions</h2><samp>300A0510 00??<br>300A923E 00??</code><br><h2>Motion Capture Change - P2's Motions</h2><samp>300A08AE 00??<br>300AAACA 00??</code><br><h2>Tekken Force Stage Skip		</h2><samp>D00A8C48 4100<br>800B6C04 0001</code><br><h2>Play As The Force Mode Enemies Crow, Falcon, Hawk And Owl - Set 1</h2><samp>D00A9134 FFFE<br>300ADD5C 0015<br>D00A915E FFFE<br>300ADD5E 0015<br>D00A9134 DFFE<br>3011868C 0003<br>D00A915E DFFE<br>30118708 0003<br>D00A9134 7FFE<br>300B8DA8 0054<br>D00A9134 EFFE<br>300B8DA8 0056<br>D00A9134 DFFE<br>300B8DA8 0057</code><br><h2>Play As The Force Mode Enemies Crow, Falcon, Hawk And Owl - Set 2</h2><samp>D00A9134 BFFE<br>300B8DA8 0055<br>D00A915E 7FFE<br>300B8E54 0054<br>D00A915E EFFE<br>300B8E54 0056<br>D00A915E DFFE<br>300B8E54 0057<br>D00A915E BFFE<br>300B8E54 0055<br>D00ADC84 000F<br>300ADC84 0000<br>D00ADC84 0010<br>300ADC84 000E</code><br><h2>Play As The Force Mode Enemies Crow, Falcon, Hawk And Owl - Set 3</h2><samp>D00ADC84 0011<br>300ADC84 0006<br>D00ADC84 0012<br>300ADC84 000C</code><br><h2>Play As The Force Mode Enemies Crow, Falcon, Hawk And Owl - Play As The Force Mode Enemies In Force Mode</h2><samp>300ADD5C 0015<br>D00A9134 DFFE<br>3011868C 0003</code><br>With this code, to use, enter Force Mode and choose any character.

Replace "xx" with the background of your choice from this list. Note that this code will crash Force Mode.<h2>Replace The Force Mode Enemies' Moves With Better Ones - Play As The Cpu In Arcade Mode</h2><samp>300AAB79 0000</code><br>With this code, the P2 pad will control the opponent in 1P Arcade Mode! This can be a fun alternative to Versus Mode with a friend... one person controls a single character, while the other gets to control each opponent... all the way up to True Ogre! It's fun!<h2>Replace The Force Mode Enemies' Moves With Better Ones - Cpu's Back Is Always Turned</h2><samp>300AAB7B 0001</code><br>With this code, the 2P side character's back will always be turned. It's fun to play the CPU this way - Watch them flail about and not be able to hit you! Remember, however, if you sidestep around you can get the CPU to face you, so watch out. This works in any mode, by the way. Try it on an unsuspecting friend!<h2>Replace The Force Mode Enemies' Moves With Better Ones - No Black Bgs (For True Ogre Fights)</h2><samp>300AFAA0 0000</code><br>With this code, it will remove the darkness that covers BGs during True Ogre fights. Since there are now polygons being used to display the BG, prepare for a tad more breakup, especially during a True Ogre VS. True Ogre match.<h2>Replace The Force Mode Enemies' Moves With Better Ones - Inivisible Life Bar</h2><samp>300AE200 0000</code><br>With this code, it makes the life bars invisible, allowing for some interesting matches... you never know when you're about to die!<h2>Replace The Force Mode Enemies' Moves With Better Ones - Super Ridiculous Code</h2><samp>300ADC19 0000</code><br>With this code, you thought my RE2 Super Ridiculous Codes were crazy? Ah, you have no idea of the mania that awaits you!
