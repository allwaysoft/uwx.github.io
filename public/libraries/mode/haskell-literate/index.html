Simple forms and validation
---------------------------

Let's start by creating a very simple datatype to represent a user:

&gt; data User = User
&gt;     { userName :: Text
&gt;     , userMail :: Text
&gt;     } deriving (Show)

And dive in immediately to create a `Form` for a user. The `Form v m a` type
has three parameters:

- `v`: the type for messages and errors (usually a `String`-like type, `Text` in
  this case);
- `m`: the monad we are operating in, not specified here;
- `a`: the return type of the `Form`, in this case, this is obviously `User`.

&gt; userForm :: Monad m =&gt; Form Text m User

We create forms by using the `Applicative` interface. A few form types are
provided in the `Text.Digestive.Form` module, such as `text`, `string`,
`bool`...

In the `digestive-functors` library, the developer is required to label each
field using the `.:` operator. This might look like a bit of a burden, but it
allows you to do some really useful stuff, like separating the `Form` from the
actual HTML layout.

&gt; userForm = User
&gt;     &lt;$&gt; "name" .: text Nothing
&gt;     &lt;*&gt; "mail" .: check "Not a valid email address" checkEmail (text Nothing)

The `check` function enables you to validate the result of a form. For example,
we can validate the email address with a really naive `checkEmail` function.

&gt; checkEmail :: Text -&gt; Bool
&gt; checkEmail = isJust . T.find (== '@')

More validation
---------------

For our example, we also want descriptions of Haskell libraries, and in order to
do that, we need package versions...

&gt; type Version = [Int]

We want to let the user input a version number such as `0.1.0.0`. This means we
need to validate if the input `Text` is of this form, and then we need to parse
it to a `Version` type. Fortunately, we can do this in a single function:
`validate` allows conversion between values, which can optionally fail.

`readMaybe :: Read a =&gt; String -&gt; Maybe a` is a utility function imported from
`Text.Digestive.Util`.

&gt; validateVersion :: Text -&gt; Result Text Version
&gt; validateVersion = maybe (Error "Cannot parse version") Success .
&gt;     mapM (readMaybe . T.unpack) . T.split (== '.')

A quick test in GHCi:

    ghci&gt; validateVersion (T.pack "0.3.2.1")
    Success [0,3,2,1]
    ghci&gt; validateVersion (T.pack "0.oops")
    Error "Cannot parse version"

It works! This means we can now easily add a `Package` type and a `Form` for it:

&gt; data Category = Web | Text | Math
&gt;     deriving (Bounded, Enum, Eq, Show)

&gt; data Package = Package Text Version Category
&gt;     deriving (Show)

&gt; packageForm :: Monad m =&gt; Form Text m Package
&gt; packageForm = Package
&gt;     &lt;$&gt; "name"     .: text Nothing
&gt;     &lt;*&gt; "version"  .: validate validateVersion (text (Just "0.0.0.1"))
&gt;     &lt;*&gt; "category" .: choice categories Nothing
&gt;   where
&gt;     categories = [(x, T.pack (show x)) | x &lt;- [minBound .. maxBound]]

Composing forms
---------------

A release has an author and a package. Let's use this to illustrate the
composability of the digestive-functors library: we can reuse the forms we have
written earlier on.

&gt; data Release = Release User Package
&gt;     deriving (Show)

&gt; releaseForm :: Monad m =&gt; Form Text m Release
&gt; releaseForm = Release
&gt;     &lt;$&gt; "author"  .: userForm
&gt;     &lt;*&gt; "package" .: packageForm

Views
-----

As mentioned before, one of the advantages of using digestive-functors is
separation of forms and their actual HTML layout. In order to do this, we have
another type, `View`.

We can get a `View` from a `Form` by supplying input. A `View` contains more
information than a `Form`, it has:

- the original form;
- the input given by the user;
- any errors that have occurred.

It is this view that we convert to HTML. For this tutorial, we use the
[blaze-html] library, and some helpers from the `digestive-functors-blaze`
library.

[blaze-html]: http://jaspervdj.be/blaze/

Let's write a view for the `User` form. As you can see, we here refer to the
different fields in the `userForm`. The `errorList` will generate a list of
errors for the `"mail"` field.

&gt; userView :: View H.Html -&gt; H.Html
&gt; userView view = do
&gt;     label     "name" view "Name: "
&gt;     inputText "name" view
&gt;     H.br
&gt;
&gt;     errorList "mail" view
&gt;     label     "mail" view "Email address: "
&gt;     inputText "mail" view
&gt;     H.br

Like forms, views are also composable: let's illustrate that by adding a view
for the `releaseForm`, in which we reuse `userView`. In order to do this, we
take only the parts relevant to the author from the view by using `subView`. We
can then pass the resulting view to our own `userView`.
We have no special view code for `Package`, so we can just add that to
`releaseView` as well. `childErrorList` will generate a list of errors for each
child of the specified form. In this case, this means a list of errors from
`"package.name"` and `"package.version"`. Note how we use `foo.bar` to refer to
nested forms.

&gt; releaseView :: View H.Html -&gt; H.Html
&gt; releaseView view = do
&gt;     H.h2 "Author"
&gt;     userView $ subView "author" view
&gt;
&gt;     H.h2 "Package"
&gt;     childErrorList "package" view
&gt;
&gt;     label     "package.name" view "Name: "
&gt;     inputText "package.name" view
&gt;     H.br
&gt;
&gt;     label     "package.version" view "Version: "
&gt;     inputText "package.version" view
&gt;     H.br
&gt;
&gt;     label       "package.category" view "Category: "
&gt;     inputSelect "package.category" view
&gt;     H.br

The attentive reader might have wondered what the type parameter for `View` is:
it is the `String`-like type used for e.g. error messages.
But wait! We have
    releaseForm :: Monad m =&gt; Form Text m Release
    releaseView :: View H.Html -&gt; H.Html
... doesn't this mean that we need a `View Text` rather than a `View Html`?  The
answer is yes -- but having `View Html` allows us to write these views more
easily with the `digestive-functors-blaze` library. Fortunately, we will be able
to fix this using the `Functor` instance of `View`.
    fmap :: Monad m =&gt; (v -&gt; w) -&gt; View v -&gt; View w
A backend
---------
To finish this tutorial, we need to be able to actually run this code. We need
an HTTP server for that, and we use [Happstack] for this tutorial. The
`digestive-functors-happstack` library gives about everything we need for this.
[Happstack]: http://happstack.com/

&gt; site :: Happstack.ServerPart Happstack.Response
&gt; site = do
&gt;     Happstack.decodeBody $ Happstack.defaultBodyPolicy "/tmp" 4096 4096 4096
&gt;     r &lt;- runForm "test" releaseForm
&gt;     case r of
&gt;         (view, Nothing) -&gt; do
&gt;             let view' = fmap H.toHtml view
&gt;             Happstack.ok $ Happstack.toResponse $
&gt;                 template $
&gt;                     form view' "/" $ do
&gt;                         releaseView view'
&gt;                         H.br
&gt;                         inputSubmit "Submit"
&gt;         (_, Just release) -&gt; Happstack.ok $ Happstack.toResponse $
&gt;             template $ do
&gt;                 css
&gt;                 H.h1 "Release received"
&gt;                 H.p $ H.toHtml $ show release
&gt;
&gt; main :: IO ()
&gt; main = Happstack.simpleHTTP Happstack.nullConf site
