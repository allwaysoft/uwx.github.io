<p>Options - <a href="less_options.html">The options above are described in full on this page</a></p>
<p>Commands</p></pre><p></p>
<p>In  the following descriptions, ^X means control-X.  ESC stands for the
ESCAPE  key;  for  example  ESC-v  means   the  two  character  sequence "ESCAPE", then "v".</p>
<pre>   h or H    Help: display a summary of these commands. If you forget all
                  the other commands, remember this one.
<p>SPACE or ^V or f or ^F<br>
Scroll forward N  lines, default one window (see  option  -z<br>
below).  If N is more  than  the screen size, only the final<br>
screenful is displayed.  Warning: some systems use ^V as a  spe-<br>
cial literalization character.</p>
<p>z      Like  SPACE, but if N is specified, it becomes the new window<br>
size.</p>
<p>ESC-SPACE<br>
Like SPACE, but scrolls a full screenful, even i  it reaches<br>
end-of-file in the process.</p>
<p>RETURN or ^N or e or ^E or j or ^J<br>
Scroll  forward N lines, default 1. The entire N lines are dis-<br>
played, even if N is more than the screen size.</p>
<p>d or ^D<br>
Scroll forward N lines, default one half of the screen size.  If<br>
N   is specified, it becomes the new default for subsequent d and<br>
u commands.</p>
<p>b or ^B or ESC-v<br>
Scroll backward N lines, default one window  (see  option  -z<br>
below).  If N is more than the screen size, only the final<br>
screenful is displayed.</p>
<p>w      Like ESC-v, but if N is specified, it becomes  the  new  window<br>
size.</p>
<p>y or ^Y or ^P or k or ^K<br>
Scroll backward N lines, default 1.  The entire N lines are dis-<br>
played, even if N is more than the screen size.  Warning:  some<br>
systems use ^Y as a special job control character.</p>
<p>u or ^U<br>
Scroll  backward  N  lines, default one half of the screen size.<br>
If N is specified, it becomes the new default for   subsequent  d<br>
and u commands.<br>
ESC-) or RIGHTARROW<br>
Scroll  horizontally right N characters, default half the screen<br>
width (see the -# option). If a  number  N is  specified,  it<br>
becomes  the  default  for  future RIGHTARROW and LEFTARROW com-<br>
mands.  While the text is scrolled, it acts  as  though  the  -S<br>
option (chop lines) were in effect.<br>
ESC-( or LEFTARROW<br>
Scroll horizontally left N characters, default half the screen<br>
width (see the -# option). If a  number   N  is  specified,  it<br>
becomes the default for future RIGHTARROW and LEFTARROW com-<br>
mands.</p>
<p>r or ^R or ^L<br>
Repaint the screen.</p>
<p>R      Repaint the screen, discarding any buffered input. Useful  if<br>
the file is changing while it is being viewed.<br>
F      Scroll  forward, and keep trying to read when the end of file is<br>
reached.  Normally this command would be used  when  already  at<br>
the  end of the file. It is a way to monitor the tail of a file<br>
which is growing while it is being viewed. (The  behavior  is<br>
similar to the “tail -f” command.)</p>
<p>g or &lt; or ESC-&lt;<br>
Go to line N in the file, default 1 (beginning of file). (Warn-<br>
ing: this can be slow if N is large.)</p>
<p>G or &gt; or ESC-&gt;<br>
Go to line N in the file, default the end of the  file. (Warn-<br>
ing:  this can be slow if N is large, or if N is not specified<br>
and standard input, rather than a file, is being read.)</p>
<p>p or % Go to a position N percent into the file. N should be between 0<br>
and 100.</p>
<p>{      If a left curly bracket appears in the top line displayed on the<br>
screen, the { command will go to  the  matching  right   curly<br>
bracket.   The matching right curly bracket is positioned on the<br>
bottom line of the screen. If there is more than one left curly<br>
bracket on the top line, a number N can be used to specify the<br>
N-th bracket on the line.</p>
<p>}      If a right curly bracket appears in the bottom line displayed on<br>
the  screen, the   }  command will go to the matching left curly<br>
bracket.  The matching left curly bracket is positioned  on  the<br>
top  line   of the screen.   If there is more than one right curly<br>
bracket on the top line, a number N can be used to  specify  the<br>
N-th bracket on the line.<br>
(      Like {, but applies to parentheses rather than curly brackets.</p>
<p>)      Like }, but applies to parentheses rather than curly brackets.</p>
<p>[      Like  {, but applies to square brackets rather than curly brackets.</p>
<p>]      Like }, but applies to square brackets rather than curly  brackets.</p>
<p>ESC-^F Followed  by two characters, acts like {, but uses the two char-<br>
acters as open and close brackets, respectively.   For  example,<br>
“ESC  ^F &lt; &gt;” could be used to go forward to the &gt; which matches<br>
the &lt; in the top displayed line.</p>
<p>ESC-^B Followed by two characters, acts like }, but uses the two   char-<br>
acters  as  open and close brackets, respectively. For example,<br>
“ESC ^B &lt; &gt;” could be used to go backward to the &lt; which matches<br>
the &gt; in the bottom displayed line.</p>
<p>m      Followed  by  any lowercase letter, marks the current position<br>
with that letter.</p>
<p>’      (Single quote.)  Followed by any lowercase  letter,  returns  to<br>
the position which was previously marked with that letter.  Fol-<br>
lowed by another single quote, returns to the position at   which<br>
the last “large” movement command was executed. Followed by a ^<br>
or $, jumps to the beginning or end of  the  file  respectively.<br>
Marks  are  preserved when a new file is examined, so the ’ com-<br>
mand can be used to switch between input files.</p>
<p><sup>X</sup>X   Same as single quote.</p>
<p>/<i>pattern</i><br>
Search forward in the file for the <i>N</i>-th line containing the pat-<br>
tern.  <i>N</i> defaults to 1.  The pattern is a regular expression, as<br>
recognized by ed.   The search starts at  the  second  line  dis-<br>
played (but see the -a and -j options, which change this).</p>
<pre><code>    Certain  characters  are  special if entered at the beginning of
    the pattern; they modify the type of search rather  than  become
    part of the pattern:

     ^N or !
      Search for lines which do NOT match the pattern.
     ^E or *
      Search multiple files. That is, if the search reaches
      the END of the current file without finding a match,  the
      search  continues in the  next file in the command line
      list.

     ^F or @
      Begin the search at the first line of the FIRST  file  in
      the  command line list, regardless of what is currently
      displayed on the screen or the settings of the -a  or  -j
      options.

     ^K
     Highlight any text which matches the pattern on the
      current screen, but don't move to the first match
     (KEEP current position).
</code></pre>
<p>^R     Don’t interpret regular expression metacharacters; that<br>
is, do a simple textual comparison.</p>
<p>?pattern<br>
Search backward in the file for the  N-th   line  containing  the<br>
pattern.   The  search starts at the line immediately before the<br>
top line displayed.</p>
<pre><code>    Certain characters are special as in the / command:
</code></pre>
<p>^N or !<br>
Search for lines which do NOT match the pattern.</p>
<p>^E or *<br>
Search multiple files.  That is, if  the  search  reaches<br>
the  beginning  of the current file  without finding a<br>
match, the search continues in the previous file  in  the<br>
command line list.</p>
<p>^F or @<br>
Begin the search at the last line of the last file in the<br>
command line list, regardless of what is  currently  dis-<br>
played  on the screen  or  the settings of the -a or -j<br>
options.</p>
<p>^K     As in forward searches.</p>
<p>^R     As in forward searches.</p>
<p>ESC-/pattern<br>
Same as “/*”.</p>
<p>ESC-?pattern<br>
Same as “?*”.</p>
<p>n      Repeat previous search, for N-th line containing the  last  pat-<br>
tern.   If the previous search was modified by ^N, the search is<br>
made for the N-th line NOT containing the pattern.  If the  pre-<br>
vious  search  was  modified  by ^E, the search continues in the<br>
next (or previous) file if not satisfied in  the  current   file.<br>
If  the  previous   search was modified by ^R, the search is done<br>
without using regular expressions.  There is no  effect  if  the<br>
previous search was modified by ^F or ^K.</p>
<p>N      Repeat previous search, but in the reverse direction.<br>
ESC-n  Repeat previous  search, but  crossing  file  boundaries.  The<br>
effect is as if the previous search were modified by *.<br>
ESC-N  Repeat previous search, but in the reverse direction and  cross-<br>
ing file boundaries.</p>
<p>ESC-u  Undo  search  highlighting.   Turn  off  highlighting of strings<br>
matching the current search pattern.  If highlighting is already<br>
off  because of a previous ESC-u command, turn highlighting back<br>
on.  Any search command will also   turn  highlighting  back  on.<br>
(Highlighting can also be disabled by toggling the -G option; in<br>
that case search commands do not turn highlighting back on.)</p>
<p>:e [<i>filename</i>]<br>
Examine a new file.  If the filename is missing,  the  “current&quot;<br>
file  (see  the :n and :p commands below) from the list of files<br>
in the command line is re-examined. A percent sign (%) in  the<br>
filename  is  replaced by the name of the current file.  A pound<br>
sign (#) is replaced by the name  of  the  previously examined<br>
file.    However,   two  consecutive percent  signs  are  simply<br>
replaced with a single percent sign. This allows you to enter a<br>
filename  that  contains a percent sign in the name.  Similarly,<br>
two consecutive pound signs are replaced  with a  single   pound<br>
sign.   The  filename  is inserted into the command line list of<br>
files so that it can be seen by subsequent :n and  :p  commands.<br>
If the filename consists of several files, they are all inserted<br>
into the list of files and the first one is  examined. If  the<br>
filename contains one or more spaces, the entire filename should<br>
be enclosed in double quotes (also see the -” option).</p>
<p><sup>X</sup>V or E<br>
Same as :e.  Warning: some systems use ^V as a special literal-<br>
ization character. On such systems, you might not be able to use<br>
^V.</p>
<p>:n     Examine the next file (from the list of files given in the command<br>
line). If a number N is specified, the N-th next file is<br>
examined.</p>
<p>:p     Examine the previous file in the command line list. If a number<br>
N is specified, the N-th previous file is examined.</p>
<p>:x     Examine  the first file in the command line list. If a number N<br>
is specified, the N-th file in the list is examined.</p>
<p>:d     Remove the current file from the list of files.</p>
<p>t      Go to the next tag, if there were more than one matches for  the<br>
current tag.  See the -t option for more details about tags.</p>
<p>T      Go  to the previous tag, if there were more than one matches for<br>
the current tag.</p>
<p>= or ^G or :f<br>
Prints some information about the file being  viewed,  including<br>
its  name and the line number and byte offset of the bottom line<br>
being displayed.  If possible, it also prints the length of  the<br>
file,  the  number  of  lines in the file and the percent of the<br>
file above the last displayed line.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<pre><code> Followed by one of the command line option letters (see  Options
</code></pre>
below),  this will change the setting of that option and print a<br>
message describing the new setting. If  a  ^P  (CONTROL-P)  is<br>
entered immediately after the dash, the setting of the option is<br>
changed but no message is printed. If the option letter  has  a<br>
numeric  value (such as -b or -h), or a string value (such as -P<br>
or -t), a new value can be entered after the option letter.   If<br>
no  new  value is entered, a message describing the current setting<br>
is printed and nothing is changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>–     Like the - command, but takes a long option  name   (see  Options<br>
below)  rather  than  a  single  option  letter.  You must press<br>
RETURN after typing the option name.  A ^P immediately after the<br>
second  dash suppresses printing of a message describing the new<br>
setting, as in the - command.</p>
<p>-+     Followed by one of the command line  option  letters  this  will<br>
reset  the  option to its  default setting and print a message<br>
describing the new setting. (The “-+X” command  does  the  same<br>
thing  as  “-+X”  on  the command line.) This does not work for<br>
string-valued options.</p>
<p>–+    Like the -+ command, but takes a long option name rather than  a<br>
single option letter.</p>
<p>-!     Followed  by  one of the command line option letters, this will<br>
reset the option to the “opposite” of its default  setting  and<br>
print  a message describing the new setting.  This does not work<br>
for numeric or string-valued options.</p>
<p>–!    Like the -! command, but takes a long option name rather than  a<br>
single option letter.</p>
<p>_      (Underscore.)  Followed  by one of the command line option let-<br>
ters, this will print a message describing the current  setting<br>
of that option.  The setting of the option is not changed.</p>
<p>__     (Double underscore.)  Like the _ (underscore) command, but takes<br>
a long option name rather than a single option letter.  You must<br>
press RETURN after typing the option name.</p>
<p>+cmd   Causes  the specified cmd to be executed each time a new file is<br>
examined.   For example, +G causes less to initially display each<br>
file starting at the end rather than the beginning.</p>
<p>V      Prints the version number of less being run.</p>
<p>q or Q or :q or :Q or ZZ<br>
Exits less.</p>
<p>The  following four commands might not be valid, depending on your<br>
particular installation.</p>
<p>v      Invokes an editor to edit the current file  being viewed. The<br>
editor is taken from the environment variable VISUAL if defined,<br>
or EDITOR if VISUAL is not defined, or defaults to “vi” if  neither<br>
VISUAL  nor EDITOR is defined.  See also the discussion of<br>
LESSEDIT under the section on PROMPTS below.</p>
<p>! <i>shell-command</i><br>
Invokes a shell to run the shell-command given.  A percent  sign<br>
(%)  in the command is replaced by the name of the current file.<br>
A pound sign (#) is replaced by the name of the previously examined<br>
file.   “!!”  repeats the last shell command.  “!” with no<br>
shell command simply invokes a  shell.   On  Unix   systems,  the<br>
shell  is taken from the environment variable SHELL, or defaults<br>
to “sh”.  On MS-DOS and OS/2 systems, the shell  is  the  normal<br>
command processor.</p>
<p>| <i>m</i> <i>shell-command</i><br>
<i>m</i>  represents  any  mark letter. Pipes a section of the input<br>
file to the given shell command. The section of the file to  be<br>
piped  is   between  the first line on the current screen and the<br>
position marked by the letter. <i>m</i> can also be ^ or $ to indicate<br>
beginning or end of file respectively.  If <i>m</i> is . or newline,<br>
the current screen is piped.</p>
<p>s <i>filename</i><br>
Save the input to a file. This only works if  the  input   is  a<br>
pipe, not an ordinary file.</p>
<p>Also: <a href="less_options.html">Options, Line editing and Language support</a></p></pre><p></p>
<p> less does not have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large input files it starts up faster than text editors like vi.</p>
<p>When the output of <span class="code">less</span> is redirected to a file, it behaves like <a href="cat.html">cat</a>, no additional output is added or input requested.</p>
