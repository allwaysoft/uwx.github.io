This is an ongoing list of games that work/partially work/don't work with the ConnectX plugin on FSD.

Possible Reasons?

There must be a timeout/minimum data rate on file access rather than just allowing the file to be accessed whatever the data rate.

Other than equipment issues it could be the following:

* Heavily used network, if the network is being heavily used it may actually crash games and give various errors like dirty disc, fatal crash, etc.
* Wireless connections can be a lot slower than wired, so if the connection is wireless at some point, either the pc end or the Xbox end, you may have many difficulties.
* Some games that do a lot of streaming may have problems due to the bandwidth limit (GTA IV Scenery springs to mind)
* Games that use large container files may also cause a problem.
  _And at the other end of the scale:_
* Games that use too many small files may cause problems.

So far, most games work really well, some are not so good. DLC *should* not be affected.

**A couple of notes:**

* Xbox1 Games do not work;
* XBLA games should work fine as generally, the game sizes on XBLA games are smaller but some may have issues.
* It has been posted that perhaps converting to GOD container would be better for some non-working/partially working games, the same could potentially be applied for GOD games that may work better as JTAG rips.
* If a game is on the 'working' lists but does not work for you, make sure you have the latest TU installed.
* If you plan to play a game over system link (Xlink Kai, etc.), I would recommend copying the game to your USB or internal drives, some games have a timeout function when waiting for players to join, so as you will have extended loading times it might cause you to be booted from games/lobbies.

A trend will hopefully be indicated as more games are added to the various lists.
