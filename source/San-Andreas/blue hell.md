Exposed: Blue Hell
Blue Hell is excisting also in GTA San Andreas, as it did in Vice City. Blue Hell is enterable through certain places in the game, that is not entierly covered with solid graphics. Many games has glitches that lets you move outside the constructed game graphics, but in GTA the developers has also put objects here. Blue Hell is therefor a somewhat more interesting to explore, as there actually is something to explore here.

One place to enter Blue Hell, is through the gym in Los Santos. You have to wear a Jetpack (cheat for PC is to type "rocketman"), and use it to go through the roof from inside the gym. While flying around, you will discover several interiors from different buildings, both buildings accessable from "street level", and interiors that are not accessible except from in Blue Hell. You will also run into pedestrians walking around, but no cars. In between you will also hear a rather heavy, scary breathing, similar to the one in the Rockstar game Manhunt.

There is a lot to see in Blue Hell, but not much to do. The most interesting you can do, is probably getting into Area 69.
