The STORY
Players take the role of a young man named Carl "C.J." Johnson, 
who thought he had escaped the gangland lifestyle by moving away from his Los Santos home. 
When his mother is murdered,  he returns to the neighborhood of his childhood,
 only to become embroiled with threats and danger from all sides. 
Because of his family and friends who remained in Los Santos, 
he's considered an enemy-on-sight to rival gang members. Even worse, perhaps, 
the corrupt local law enforcement frames him for a crime he did not commit.
To clear his name and save his family, 
C.J. sets out on a long journey that will lead him all across the state.

Hint: Play Basketball
Head to the left of Sweet's house (and go into the back yard) 
in your neighborhood to find a basketball court.
Pick up the ball and follow the onscreen instructions to play some hoop.

Hint: Easy Money for Cleaning the Hood
Anytime you kill a drug dealer, you will net $2000. 
Drug dealers normally wear black jackets (some have white hoodies) 
and stand still waiting for people to talk to them. 
Kill as many as you can find to build up your cash stash quickly.

Hint: Easy Firearms
Head out behind your house in Los Santos and go down into the aqueduct.
 Go down the slope and head right along the walkway to locate a 
nice Mini SMG. You'll also find a pistol in Sweet's backyard.

Hint: Easy Body Armor
Go out behind the house and into the aqueduct to the left. 
Go down the sloped wall of the aqueduct and head left. 
On an incline underneath the bridge, you'll find a handy vest.

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Easter Eggs
When you finish some missions (for example: 555 we tip) 
listen to the radio. 
You'll hear the person talking about the mission just passed.

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Easter Egg: Rockstar Cameos
In one of Zero's mission, where you have to use the machine gun to 
knock down the RC planes, you can see some action figures of 
Rockstar characters like Tommy Vercetti, Lance Vance, 
as well as characters from other games in 
Rockstar's line-up during Zero's dialogue.

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Hint: Bullet Proof Cars
During the mission "High Stakes, Low Rider", 
keep the competition closely behind you until the pier finish line. 
Once the race is over the other cars appear behind you.

With another car or by just walking, 
push Ceasar's red car up the pier and over the edge of the 
sidewalk into your nearby safe house garage to the left. 
What's the point of all this? 
Not only is it a pimp red car, it's also BULLET PROOF, 
which helps alot this early in the game.


Moon world    or Inside-Out-Town
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Easter Egg: Inside-Out-Town

Walk to the yellow marker with the jetpack, 
and fly straight up. 
You'll go straight up through the roof. Now, land on the roof.

Land right on/near the marker, take off the jetpack, 
and walk inside the marker. 
You'll enter the Angel Pine Motel building. 
Grab your jetpack (if you see it), or respawn it again with a cheat. 
You can now fly up, and around the interior universe.
this is like the underworld but Not.    its more like a Moon world

After you complete the game, you can roam anywhere. As an added bonus, you can steal a train. If you press R3 while on the train, a freight train mission will start. You must drive to a train stop and deliver the freight. Be careful not to go too fast or you will derail. The easiest way to avoid derailment is go as fast as you can. However, if your controller starts to vibrate, release X.

Successfully complete level 2 of the Freight Train missions to get $50,000 and free train rides.

Fire truck missions bonus 
Steal a fire truck and press R3. Successfully complete level 12 of the fire truck missions to make CJ fireproof.

Easily complete fire truck missions 
Bring a fire truck from another location into Angel Pine, then press R3 to start the mission. This should be easier than doing it in Los Santos, San Fierro, the desert, or Las Venturas. When you do it at this location, and you are stuck on a cliff that you cannot get up (for example, if the burning car is on the freeway), take your time by taking the long way. You should only use this method if you have at least three minutes or more time remaining. Note: All fires will not always appear in Angel Pine, as they may also happen in Whetstone or other nearby places. Although this sounds difficult, there are not that many roads near the Angel Pine area which actually makes it easier to complete. If the fire truck gets severely damaged, enable the "Health" code.

All the victims will appear in the city, which is very small. The farthest person will only be about ten seconds away from the drop off point. You can complete the missions in less then ten minutes by doing this. Also, the cops do not appear very often, allowing your wanted level to remain low. Additionally, do the Paramedic mission in the Angel Pine area. Press R3 to start the missions. All injured people that must be taken to the hospital will be in the crowded town. Unlike the fire truck missions if done in this town, this mission has all the people in one place. Once you complete this mission, you will your health increased to 150. This is a also very good reward because you can jump from the highest place in the game without dying from the fall. Note: If you have the parachute in your inventory, you will die.

Pimping missions bonus 
Steal the pimp convertible in the car wash parking lot near the Pay N' Spray and press R3. Successfully complete level 10 of the pimping missions to get money from prostitutes instead of paying them.

Quarry missions bonus 
Successfully complete level 7 of the Quarry missions to get the Hunter Quarry asset and Quarry Mission time-trials.

Taxi missions bonus 
Steal a taxi and press R3. After a total of 50 successful fares, you will unlock hydraulics and nitrous on all taxi-class vehicles. Press L3 to jump whenever needed. Press the L1 or Circle while driving normally to use nitrous. After using nitrous, you must wait awhile between shots. However, that time decreases as your driving skill increases.

Truck missions bonus 
Steal a truck and press R3. Successfully complete level 8 of the trucking missions to unlock RS Haul as a property.

Valet Parking missions bonus 
Successfully complete level 5 of the Valet Parking missions in downtown San Fierro to get the San Fierro Valet Parking as an asset property.

Vigilante missions bonus 
Steal any policy vehicle and press R3. Successfully complete level 12 of the vigilante missions to get an armor limit of 150.

Easily completvigilante missions 
e Use the Rhino to complete the vigilante missions easier. Additionally, start the mission, put the vehicle in your garage, and exit so that the door closes. Enable the "Destroy all cars" code. The criminals will be killed. Run back to the garage, hop in the car, and repeat. This is also a good way to quickly gain more money and status points.

Steal any law enforcement vehicle and enable the "Deadly vehicle" code. If you enter the cheat code in the vehicle, you must get out of the car then get back in or the car will not resist damage, but will blow up anything it touches, and result in your car eventually exploding. After this, press R3 and go at a slow speed (about 5 to 15 mph) and enable the "Destroy all cars" code. Note: If you go too slow or too fast, CJ will exit the car, making your vehicle blow up as well when you complete code entry. The enemy should blow up no matter where he is and result in a "Threat Eliminated" message and give you the reward money. Note: After level 26 is reached, your car becomes more explosion prone, as the "Deadly vehicle" code eventually wears off.

Get an FBI Rancher and drive onto the Julius Thruway in Las Venturas. Start Vigilante mode and begin driving around the highway. Just stay on the highway, and you will notice that the criminals start dying for no apparent reason. Just drive for about twenty minutes to get the 150 armor award easily.

Increase respect, money, driving skill and armor in vigilante missions 
Enable the "Spawn Rhino tank" code and use it for the vigilante missions. When you reach level 12, your armor will increase to 150. Each time you kill a group of criminals, you will get money (on level 20 and over you will be winning $50,000 or more). If you get a wanted level, do not cheat to lower it. As police ram you, they will explode and your respect will increase. All the driving that you will do increases your driving skill somewhat.

 

 

Horseshoe bonus 
Collect all fifty horseshoes in Las Venturas to get a M4, MP5, combat shotgun, and satchel charges to appear at the Four Dragons Casino.

Oyster bonus 
Collect all fifty oysters to increase your sex appeal and lung capacity. Note: To find the oysters faster, get a Sea Sparrow (which can land on water). You can find one by the Sherman Dam.

Racing bonus 
Get first place in all races at the four racing locations across San Andreas (marked with a checkered flag on the map/radar) to win $1,000,000.

Snapshot bonus 
Take all fifty snapshots in San Fierro to get a sniper rifle, Micro SMG, shotgun, and grenades to appear at your San Fierro garage.

Tag bonus 
Spray all one hundred hidden tags in Los Santos to get an AK-47, Tec-9, Sawn-off shotgun, and Molotov cocktails to appear inside your house on Grove Street.


 

100% game completion bonuses 
Successfully complete the game with a 100% game completion. CJ will get a stats boost, extra money, and a Rhino and Hydra will be delivered to CJ's house on Grove Street.

Increase muscle or stamina 
At about 22:00, go to a gym and work out, maxing yourself. After you have worked out enough for the day, wait another minute until the time is 0:00. Max yourself out for that day then go home. Save two or three times and you can repeat this process.

To get your character maxed out in the muscle and stamina attributes, do the following. Go the gym near the Johnson house. Work out until you are told that it is enough for one day. Go home (right down the block), save the game to advance to the next day. Return to the gym and you can work out again. You can now max out your muscle and stamina in less then a half hour.

Note: This trick requires a controller with a turbo feature. Go to a gym or Madd Dogg's mansion. Get on the treadmill and set it to level 7, 8, or 9. Enable the turbo feature and just hold X instead of tapping it. Your stamina will increase easily. You can also do this with weights, but you will have to tap Circle and X a little bit.

Increase weapon skill 
Achieve a high wanted level and go into a restaurant. Shoot everyone with the weapon that you want to raise in rank. If you walk around and wait, police will spawn, but will not shoot you. Police can raise your weapon skill faster than pedestrians. This works best in Burger Shot because of the wide area that you can walk around in. Continue until you reach Hitman status.

Use the following trick in front of any safe house. Use the gun you want to get up to Hitman status to repeatedly shoot a car until it explodes. Then, go to the next car. Repeat this until you reach Hitman status for that weapon. Watch out for the police. You can shoot them, then keep shooting the cars. When you are almost dead, enter your safe house and save the game. Your health will be restored and wanted level removed.

Get lots of bullets for the guns that you want Hitman or Gangster status for. Go to Tierra Robada. Look around at the north of the island to find a little house. Stay in there and enable the "Increase wanted level" code three times. Stay in the cabin and wait for the police to approach. When they enter the house, kill them.

To attain Hitman level quicker, select your desired weapon and go to a Pay 'N' Spray. Park your vehicle directly next to the Pay 'N' Spray. Exit the vehicle and repeatedly shoot people, cars, and cops. When your wanted level is raised to two stars or above, run to your vehicle and drive into the Pay 'N' Spray to cancel it. If your vehicle is not damaged, the respray is free. Wait for the wanted stars to stop flashing, then start shooting people again.

Go into a police station and find a room with one entry point, and something that you can hide behind (like a desk). Take out your weapon. You should now have a two star wanted level. Shoot any cop who comes through the door. Every cop you shoot makes your gun skill go up by about five. Do this until you either die, run out of bullets, or enable the "Lower wanted level" code.

Increase driving skill 
Go to San Fierro and pass the tests at the driving school. Additionally, find a tractor or a slow moving car. Drive the roads without going as fast as you can (move slowly). This will take awhile, but will increase your driving skills.

Increase bike skill 
Enable the "Massive BMX bunny hops" code. Keep jumping very high by holding L1 for a long time. As you jump, do some flips (backwards or any funny stunt) and land perfectly. You will then receive a unique stunt award or an insane stunt award and your skill will increase. To do this perfectly without falling while doing the stunts, use the "Never fall off your bike" glitch. Get some speed, jump as high as possible, do stunts, and do not fall. This will increase CJ's bike skill.

Increase underwater skill 
Repeatedly swim underwater to increase your lung capacity and your underwater skill.

Easily max Lung Capacity 
Dive underwater, and once your breath is out, you will start losing health. If you want to stay underwater, keep enabling the "Armor, health, money, and street creds" code when your health is low. You will be able to remain underwater, and max your Lung Capacity attribute easily.

Restore breath faster 
When you are swimming and are about to run out of breath, return to the surface. Keep jumping up and down with Square. Your breath meter will refill faster.

Raising stats quicker 
Go to any pier over any body of water. Swim under the pier and stay in one position. This will immensely raise your muscle, stamina, and lung capacity in just under a minute. Stay under longer for better results.

Return to land faster 
If you get stuck in the water, enable the "Spawn Hotring Racer" then "Spawn Jetpack" codes. It will not appear until you are on a non watery surface. Quickly jump on the car. It may be a far ride, but it is better than swimming.

Run faster 
To run faster, enable the "Spawn Jetpack" code. Then, hold X while pressing the Left Analog-stick Forward. If done correctly, CJ will run faster than any car.

Infinite running boost 
Enable the "Spawn Jetpack" code. When you have the Jetpack on, take it off. Then, get about thirty feet behind it so you have running distance. Run into it by using the running boost (hold Left Analog-stick Up and keep tapping X). Just before you run into the Jetpack, release X and keep the Left Analog-stick in running position. This will give you unlimited running boost until the Left Analog-stick is released.

Unlock areas quickly 
Enable the "Wanted level never increases" code. Go to the shaded areas of the game and they will become unlocked. If you go to a safe house and save the game, all areas will be unlocked from now on. However, in order not to be wanted when you go back into these areas, you must enable the "Wanted level never increases" code again, but you will be free to roam about.

Revealing territories 
Get a plane and fly all the way to either the southeast, southwest, northeast, or northwest of the map where the ocean is found. Keep flying for thirty minutes in that direction, then jump out of the plane. Do not open the parachute and intentionally drown. When you arrive at the hospital, check your map. You will see that there are enormous amounts of new territories in San Fierro, Las Venturas, and some in Las Santos. You can take over these territories, and they only have one wave.

Quick map fill in Los Santos 
To get all of the map showing in the starting area of the game, get on the freeway and continue going until you cannot go further. Then, pause the game and the entire bottom right half of the map should be marked as explored.

 

 

Gain respect


To gain respect, stay in your neighborhood and get a wanted star, then kill all the police that arrives. Once you reach a four star wanted level (and if you killed enough police), you will gain some respect. Additionally, completing missions is not the only way to earn respect. By spraying other gang's tags, you will also earn a bit, and by taking over another gang's area you will earn a lot. Note: You must have completed some missions before you can take over areas. You can see on the radar witch areas you have taken over, and which areas the enemy gangs own. Your own territory is marked with green, and your enemies are yellow or purple.

Respect status 
Your respect is made up of the following factors:

Running Respect (see below): 40% 
Mission Progress: 36% 
Territory Under Control: 6% 
Money: 6% 
Fitness: 4% 
Clothes: 4% 
Girlfriend Progress: 4% 
Your Running Respect is changed by the following factors:

Territory gained: +30% 
Killing a gang member: +.5% 
Killing a dealer: +.005% 
Killing a member of your gang: -.005% 
A member of your gang is killed: -2% 
Territory lost: -3% 
Your respect affects the number of gang members that you can recruit:

Above 1%: 2 
Above 10%: 3 
Above 20%: 4 
Above 40%: 5 
Above 60%: 6 
Above 80%: 7

Easy money   PS2
In order to waste time to allow money to accumulate without dealing with CJs eating needs, simply press Triangle in front of the television in your hideout. His health will remain constant, without him needing to eat. You can leave the PlayStation 2 idling in this state to accumulate money easily.

Walk into a bar and beat up all the customers with a bat, nightstick, or pool cue. More customers spawn and your wanted level will not rise. No one pulls out a gun, and your maximum health will increase after a number of fights. Beating up the person next to the pool tables gets you a pool cue, and every once in awhile a customer will spill a few hundred dollars.

Find a save point that is close to a betting shop. The one in the Montgomery are is ideal because it is near to the save point where you have to do the four missions for Catalina. Save your game, then go to the betting shop and bet all your money on a horse. It takes awhile to enter the numbers, but is worth it because you can make a huge amount of cash (especially if you bet on horses with odds of 10/1, 11/1, 12/1, etc.). It takes roughly three to four minutes to bet the maximum amount of money, which is $9,999,995. You will not win every time. When you lose, reload your last saved game. It is possible to get $250,000,000 by betting your winnings of $30,000 to $700.000 to $2,000,000 to the maximum bet.

Enable the "Deadly vehicle" and "Flying cars" codes. When you are up in the air, fly down to the ground and hit it to get money for a unique trick. The higher you go and hit the ground, the more money you can make. You can also deactivate the code while in the air and hit the ground to make a lot of money.

Enable the "Flying cars" code. Fly around for a few seconds, then touch the ground. You will get money for insane stunts.

While on a BMX bike, enable the "Massive bunny hops" code. Then, hold L1 and jump. While in the air, hold L1 and as soon as you hit the ground release the button. Do this continuously to get big combos.

Easy Hitman rating 
Shoot at the black part of a wheel. If you shoot at the rim it will not work. Keep on shooting until the skill bar is all the way up for the desired weapon.

Easy dual sawn-off shotgun ability 
It is recommended that you spray all 100 tags, as it is easier for ammunition and early on missions. Get a cop car (preferably a car, OT truck, rancher, etc.). Save it in the Johnson family garage; save the game if desired. Get a large amount of sawn-off shotgun ammunition. If all 100 tags were sprayed, it is available in Johnson kitchen. Go to the garage. Get as far away from the car as possible without letting the garage door close. Then crouch, aim for the grill of the police car, and shoot. Every few shots (or every time the car catches fire), you should have more weapon skill. It will eventually upgrade about every minute. When it catches on fire, let the garage repair the car and come back. This does not work as well at getting Hitman on the other weapons.

Easy money in Los Santos 
From the Johnson house in the Ganton area, go straight until you are in the front yard of the house opposite of yours. Turn right, and go behind it by going between that house and the one next to it. Go in the backyard until you are in the corner. You should see a pistol. Take it, then get back to Grove Street. If you see man, usually in black, that is standing there with his arms crossed, shoot him. He usually carries about $2,000 or more and a pistol, because he is a drug dealer. Repeat this to get easy money. Kill him quickly before he shoots you. It is possible to get $50,000 in one day by doing this.

Upon exiting the Johnson house in Grove Street, walk straight toward the house opposite of yours, which is the one that sometimes has the BMX bike in the front yard, until you are in the grass. Go to your right between that house and the one next to it. Walk toward the corner and get the pistol. Go back to Grove Street and find a drug dealer. He is dressed in black with his hands crossed down at his hips. You will know he is a drug dealer because if you face him, he will try to do business. You will get a pop-up display in the top-right part of your screen on how to respond to him, even though you cannot actually buy anything. If you shoot and kill him, he drops $2,000 dollars or more, and a gun just like that one you picked up. Note: He will shoot back -- try to get a headshot. There is another drug dealer that is wearing a white hooded sweatshirt that does the same thing. He can usually be found up in the northeast part of Los Santos. You can find these dealers all over Los Santos in the areas littered with gangs.

Go to the building with the parachute. When you get to the top, spawn a Caddy. Get in and drive slowly towards the edge of the building, then just fall off. You will begin to flip slowly. However, if you nudge the edge of the building, the Caddy will spin and flip like crazy. When you hit the ground, you will get a very large insane stunt bonus.

Find the Inside Track Betting building in the Downtown area. Bet the maximum amount on the horse with the worst odds. If you lose, reload the game and try again. When you win, it will be a substantial amount.

Go to the Pig Pen Strip Club. You can jump on the big stage with the srtipper. Stand directly in front of her, and people will throw $100 to her each time, which you can collect. Be very careful not to touch her, or the guards will start shooting at you. Note: This cheat takes awhile -- eat before you go.

Get a weapon, then stand outside the your house in the Ganton area. Shoot your homies (wearing green). Some of them will drop a lot of money. Pick it up, and if you have a wanted level go inside and save the game. Repeat this to get a large amount of money.

This trick requires maximum bike skill for both motorcycles and a regular bike. Go to the highest building in Los Santos, the circular one, and jump off using either the motorcycle or bike. While you are in mid-air, you can spin for a little bit or try to do a back flip. Stay on the bikes until you land and you will receive an insane stunt bonus for over $200.

Enable the "Kinky theme" code and enter the Ganton area with a nice car. Drive up the alley were the burglar truck is located. Park there and within seconds prostitutes will approach. Press Left to accept their offer, then get out of your car and kill them when they are done. You will get more money than paid.

Easy Stamina upgrade in Los Santos 
Go to the Ganton Gym in Los Santos. Go to the bicycle and start at level 1. Work your way up to level 10. After awhile it will say that you have worked to your limit and to return. Keep pedaling and your stamina will start to increase.

Use the following trick to get a lot of weapons, increase your muscle, increase your stamina, and get a "Hitman" rating with any weapon. After the initial mission, go to the Verona beach area (on the south part of the map near the ocean). There is a free open gym here. Use it to increase your muscle and stamina. when you need to eat, there is a free hot dog stand down the path east of the gym, or just save the game at your house. To get "Hitman" status with any gun, find the weapon of your choice and shoot people or cars. Try going to any parking lot and shooting cars. It is easier and they respawn if you ride a short distance away and return. You can get as much money as desired doing the fire truck missions, then going to the off track betting after getting at least $10,000. Bet 10% of your money on the last horse until you win. If you lose too much money, reload your game and return. Repeat this process until you have a good amount of money.

Easy weapons in Los Santos 
Drive around and hit Ballas. When they are dead, pick up their guns then get back in your car and find more. This will get you a lot of weapons very fast.

Easy Hitman rating in Los Santos 
This trick requires a controller in port two. To get an easy Hitman rating for either the 9 mm pistol or shotgun, go to the Los Santos Police Department. Note the two player icon across the street. Quickly enter the Police Department. Run and ignore any cops shooting at you and get the armor in the locker room. It is the first room on your right. There is an available pistol in the room on the right, at the far end of the hall. Proceed to dispose of the police using your pistol. If you need ammunition, the cops will drop a gun after you kill them. Your weapon skill will quickly raise as you kill the swarms of police that come after you. Continue shooting until your armor level becomes low or is gone. Then, run to the far end of the police station hall, down the stairs, and into the holding cells. In the middle cell is more armor. Use it and continue your massacre until your armor is once again depleted. Next, quickly run out of the door and across the street to the two player icon. Press R3 on controller two to enter two player mode. Simply kill the second player and your wanted level will be gone and your health will be refilled. Repeat this to gain Hitman status or simply gain ammunition. Note: Hitman status with the pistols will allow duel wielding, faster firing, improved accuracy, lock-on range increased and faster strafing. There is also a shotgun hidden in the police station in the room on your left as you enter, then to the room at the right at the end of that one. The shotgun may not respawn as soon as you enter, but in at least 60 seconds one should appear. You can use this available shotgun to reach Hitman status with. Note: Hitman status with the shotgun only gives you improved accuracy, move while firing, faster firing rate and lock-on range increased -- not duel wielding. Duel wielding can only be achieved with the sawed-off shotgun.

To raise your weapon skills quickly, enter a dance club, such as the "Alhambra" in the Idlewood area. Begin shooting people with the weapon of your choice. Doing so during the afternoon or night hours (12:00 to 04:00) greatly increases the amount of people that respawn in the club. Since so many people spawn, you have a virtually limitless amount of people to "train" with. Doing so however, raises your wanted level greatly. Enable the "Lower wanted level" code or know where the police bribes are, as you will need them.

Go to the actual beach part of the Verona Beach area. Start shooting with the desired gun. The cops will arrive after awhile, but you can make them go away or just kill them for more. Keep doing this until the desired gun is at Hitman level. It is possible to get four weapons up to Hitman level in about an hour.

Walk out from CJ's house and make sure there a car in his garage. Use any weapon to shoot the car in the garage until it catches on fire. Walk away and let the garage close Then, open it and repeat the steps. You can do this with any weapon to get an easy Hitman level.

Go into the bar near CJ's house in the Ganton area. Kill everyone there and try to get a two or three star wanted level. Start killing the police that come through the door. When no one remains, turn around and look. They should be there.

Go to your house in Grove Street. Start randomly killing people until you have two star wanted level. Kill all the cops with any desired weapon. Make sure you have armor on. When you have low health, save the game, then repeat.

Drive to the Burger restaurant where OG Loc is working. Mark the location of the Pay 'N' Spray near the beach closest to this spot on your map. Go into the restaurant with a two or three star wanted level. Order food if needed, then hold the place up. Everyone will crouch down into a fetal position. You may kill them if desired, as they have some money. The police will morph into the building but they will be in the same position as the customers. They will not shoot you, never stop coming in (usually seven at a time). You have all the time needed to reach Hitman status on any gun. Make sure you have at least 400 bullets or more. You may also go back out and immediately return if you get hungry, but you must hurry to the counter. Sometimes the police will be eating there and they will shoot at you immediately. However, as soon as you aim your gun, they will stop, but the food will not be available if this is done. When you are finished, make sure all seven officers are alive in the building (this seems to cause less police shooting at you on the outside), then hold X + Left Analog-stick Right to run around to the back of the building. There are always two vehicles parked here. Take one and make two rights then a left to the Pay 'N' Spray. Wait inside until the flashing stars disappear. Do this for two weapons and you will have over half your reputation easily.

Easy races 
Before you enter a race, enable the "Cars fly away" code. During the countdown, start entering the "Pedestrians riot" code, but do not press the final button until they take off. Run over all the racers and ram their cars.

Easy Pilot license 
Go to the airport in San Fierro and enable the "Spawn Jetpack" code. Enter the Shamel jet and enable the "Speed up time" code. Fly it until a message appears in the corner. Fly it for about five or ten more minutes and you will have a pilot license without going to pilot school. Note: Make sure you save the game.

Saving money 
Buy lots of ammunition for the Tec-9 which costs about $300. When you have enough, buy one SMG. The game will transfer all your Tec-9 ammunition into your SMG, saving you thousands of dollars. Note: This does not work for the pistols, rifles, or thrown weapons.

Free Pay N' Spray 
Get a car that can be used for the pimping missions. Go to a Pay N' Spray. When the door is closing, press R3 to activate the pimping missions. Then press R3 to deactivate the missions after the door has closed and is re-opening. The door will open again, giving you a free spray. You can repeat this as many times as desired.

Cheap car bomb 
Get a fast car or a motorcycle. Either shoot the vehicle or bang it up real good. When it is on fire, press Triangle to jump out. This technique is also good for taking over hoods quickly and easily.

Descend quickly 
When stuck at the top of a cliff or mountain and you need to go to the bottom, do not bother going the long way around to get down safely. Instead, edge yourself to the end of the cliff/mountain and slowly but surely you will slide down the side and land safely at the bottom.

Lose weight quickly 
If you want to lose weight quickly, enable the "Speed up time" code.

Jump off building with motorcycles or bikes in Los Santos 
Take any motorcycle or bike to the entrance of the tallest building in Los Santos. You will be taken to the roof. Note: This only works with this building and two-wheeled vehicles.

Basketball Challenge mini-game 
Go to one of the basketball courts that have full courts and a chain link fence round them. One of the hoops will have a basketball. Walk up to the basketball and press Triangle to start playing. While playing basketball, press R3 to start the Basketball Challenge mini-game. A red marker will appear on the court. Run to the red marker and shoot the ball. If you make the shot, the red marker will move to a new spot on the court. The goal of the mini-game is to sink as many shots as you can before time runs out. Each shot you make adds a few seconds on to the clock. When time runs out, CJ will automatically resume playing basketball. Your highest score will be recorded and shown the next time you play the Basketball Challenge mini-game.

Basketball tricks 
While playing basketball, press Circle to spin the ball on your finger. Press Square to roll the ball along your shoulders.

Play basketball in Los Santos 
After completing the Taggin Up Turf mission, you can go beside Sweet's house. There will be a basketball court with a basketball in the middle. Walk up to it and press Triangle to play basketball. Note: You can only play by yourself.

Play pool and arcade games in Los Santos 
Go out of CJ's neighborhood in Ganton. At night, you will see a bar with beer bottles flashing on top of it. It is next to the bridge. Go inside the bar, and there will be a man next to the pool table. Walk up to him and press Triangle to play a game of pool. You can also bet money on the game. There are also arcade games you can play in the bar.

Play video game in Los Santos 
Go in CJ's living room and walk up to the television. Press Triangle to play "They Came From Uranus".

Practice     in Los Santos 
dance movesIn the Idlewood area (between the three way highway section and the red line where the train is passing on your map) is the Alhambra Club. You can find it easily by the four torches at the entrance. Once there, you can practice your dance by pressing the corresponding buttons (X, Circle, Triangle, and Square) as shown on the screen). You can also play some video games at the arcade machine or buy some food or drinks at the vending machines.

Bet on horses 
Near the Downtown and Mulholland Intersection areas (under the highway, next to the big parking lot), is a building called Inside Track Betting (with red/pink/blue posters). The entrance is just in front of it, and you can play a horse race game. You first bet on one of the horse to win, then the amount of money. Afterwards you can see the race.

Play pool for free 
First, enter a bar, such as "The Green Bottle" in the Ganton area of Los Santos. Find a pool table and wager whatever desired. If you lose the game, just use the cue stick to hit the person who just took your money to death. Then, pick the money he drops, which may be slightly more than your bet. Additionally, when you walk in the bar, either play a game of pool or just kill the man standing there and take his pool stick. Square up with the pool table and start pressing Circle. The pool balls should move.

Free pool shots 
When playing pool you can get a free shot by pressing Triangle as you take your shot and hit the ball. If done correctly, you should hit the ball and your cue should follow your white ball like if you had never taken your shot. If you pot the white ball by doing this, it freezes your game. Simply press Triangle as you press the Right Analog-stick Forward and you will get an extra shot every time.

Vending machines 
When you find a vending machine that serves chips, zoom in on it with a pistol or rifle. It is blurry, but you can tell that the chips inside the machine are real-life brands. Some chips that can be easily identified are Doritos, Lay's Potato Chips, and Munchos, to name a few.

Vending machine in Los Santos 
Go to the bar near Ganton but do not go in. Instead, look around the bar and close to the bridge will be a drink machine. Go up to it and press Triangle to pay $1 for a drink.

Breaking fences 
Walk up to a fence and either punch it or cut it with a chainsaw.

Stop climbing fence or ledge 
To stop climbing a fence or ledge, tap Triangle while CJ is trying to get over.

Climbing trees 
To climb a tree, find a ledge that will allow you to jump to the branches at the top of a tree. If you hit them correctly, CJ should grab onto the branches and allow you to pull him up. There is an easily accessible one just outside of Glen Park Hospital to practice with.

Destroying cars quickly 
To quickly blow up cars, shoot the gas tank. This is useful when killing a lot of people at once.

Lock on enemies 
When fighting someone (not with gun), press R1 to lock on to them.

Expand and shrink moon 
Use a sniper rifle to shoot the moon to make it expand, then shrink in size.

Eating too much 
If you eat too much in a restaurant you will vomit on the floor and the cashier will laugh at you. After this happens, you cannot eat again for a while.

Effects of being fat 
When you are fat, CJ will say different phrases. For example, when you are fighting he will say "I got weight on my side," or "I may be big, but I ain't slow". The downside to being fat is that when your body fat meter gets full, you run the risk of having a heart attack. This only happens in very rare circumstances. You will return to the nearest hospital. Also, if you have no muscle stat, or very little, you may not be able to climb high walls or "super sprint". When fat, CJ will waddle around like a penguin, and if you look closely (this happens with no shirt) the fat on his body will wobble.

Take a photo of yourself 
Have the camera active as your current weapon, then target a member of your own gang. Press L1 to give them the camera and they will snap a picture of CJ. Alternately, have the camera and recruit a gang member. Switch to the camera and get close to the gang member you just recruited. There will be a menu pop up on the top left, telling you to press L1. After you press L1, get into place and take the picture.

Radio stations diss each other 
Listen to Radio Los Santos and K-DST. On Radio Los Santos, at times between songs, Julio G. (station DJ) will make fun of the Playback FM DJ, saying "Playback FM has some cool records, but the DJ is wack," and Tommy "Nightmare" Smith, (K-DST DJ) will make fun of the Radio X DJ, usually just before the song "Running Down a Dream". He will say, "You know, I can't bear that chick on Radio X, or is it Rock X, Rock...listen sweetheart, get over it."

Radio shout-out from Denise 
After you obtain Denise as you girlfriend after the Burning Desire mission, listen to Radio Los Santos. At times between songs, Julio G. (the DJ) will have a shout-out from Denise to you, and at the end he criticizes the shout out by saying "I got a shout out from Denise in Ganton who says she misses her boy desperately. And I quote, desperately. Hey, you know, this isn't Lonely Hearts, this is Radio Los Santos."

Screensaver 
Allow the game to idle for a few minutes. The HUD will disappear and the game will zoom in on other nearby people instead of CJ.

Wanted level officers, weapons, and vehicles 
Depending on your wanted level, different law enforcement vehicles, officers, and weapons will be used against you:

One star: Police officers on foot, in cars, and HPV1000s (police bikes) will go after you. They have 9mms and nightsticks. If you do not have a gun out, they will try to beat you with their nightsticks. If you have a gun out, they will shoot.

Two stars: Police officers in cars and HPV1000s will come after you. They will have 9mms and nightsticks, although they will not use their nightsticks. They will shoot at you no matter what. If you are in a car, cops will drive faster after you.

Three stars: Police officers in cars will go after you. They will have the same weapons. Police choppers are now involved and shoot you from their guns. Police cars will go fast enough to be able to keep up with you and roadblocks will be in place at times, with officers shooting 9mms at your car.

Four stars: Cops in cars and SWAT officers will come after you in Enforcers (SWAT vans). SWAT officers will now rappel from the police choppers. SWAT officers are now in roadblocks and SWAT officers will have Micro SMGs. If you are in an aircraft, a Hydra will go after you to shoot you down.

Five stars: FBI agents will go after you with FBI Ranchers. Most authorities going after you will be the FBI; there will be less cop and SWAT cars. The police chopper still goes after you, and the FBI will replace the SWAT men in roadblocks. FBI agents carry SMGs.

Six stars: Military soldiers will go after you in Rhinos (tanks) and Barracks trucks. They will replace the FBI in roadblocks. The army will carry M4s.

Recruiting gang members 
Press R1 to target a gang member, then press D-pad Up.

Saving gang members 
To save a gang member or bodyguard when you turn off the game, go to your safe house. Go to your garage, run in the garage with your bodyguards. Run out without your bodyguards, and then save the game.

Gang member drive-by 
Once you have a level one Respect upgrade, go to Grove street and walk up to a gang member (dressed in green). Without a gun equipped, hold R1 on a gang member and press D-pad Up. You have now recruited him into your own personal mini-gang. If you get into a car, they will follow you. If you get three gang members and get in a four-door car, you can drive through Balla territory and your homies will lean out of the car and shoot at the Ballas who are driving by or standing around. They will also attack anyone who could be a threat to you (for example, the police). You can get only one gang member on the back of a PCJ-600, and no gang members on a Rhino. Note: To tell your members to stay, hold R1 and press D-pad Down. To tell them to follow you, hold R1 and press D-pad Up.

Taking over gang territories easily 
An easy way to take over territories is to find a high place like a roof top. First, kill a few gang members to start the war, then get onto a roof. When you are up there, they will still shoot at you, but will not have accurate aim and will miss frequently.

Note: It is recommended that the "Air Strip" missions be completed first. To easily take over territories, go to the airstrip and take the Jetpack. Go to any enemy territory and start a gang war by killing some enemy gang members. Fly and land on any building roof you can easily see incoming enemy gang members. Kill all gang members from up there. By doing this, you can easily hold all enemy territories. Be patient when killing gang members, and try to stay inside the war zone. The distance between the airstrip and enemy territories is long, but this is the easiest way to quickly and safely hold enemy gang territories. All territories can be held by using the Jetpack, but only one by one.

Keep gang territory easily 
If your gang turf is under attack, go to a save point and save the game. When it is done saving, your turf will no longer be under attack and it will still be yours. Additionally, when your hood is under attack, find a police car or motorcycle, fire truck, ambulance, or taxi. Get in and press R3 to start the vehicle's missions. Then, press R3 again to exit and your hood will be safe.

Unlock more gang territories in Los Santos 
Get in a Rustler from the abandoned airport and fly southeast. Once you pass Los Santos International Airport, fly to the top of the second altitude bar and release X to allow the plane fly in autopilot. About every three minutes, look at your stats and examine the Gang section to find that the Vagos or the Ballas have gained a territory. Sometimes the Grove Street also takes more territories. To get the entire map filled with gang territories, let the plane autopilot for over two hours. Check you plane periodically so that it does not crash in the ocean. Once you die, the territories will be visible on the map.

Gang member race 
You can do this trick in any race mission with the checkered flag on your map. Bring a gang member with you. You can even bring three if the race is with a four door car. Walk into the red mission circle. Select a race and when it starts and counts down, you will see your gang member spawn to the street and walk towards your car. The races will start, and you must wait a moment before he gets in your car.

Gang member poses

Moving fire 
Notice that when you use your flamethrower and are aimed at the floor, you create a small flame or a few that expire in awhile. When they begin to arise, the fire truck arrives and extinguishes the fire. To do this glitch, eat something beforehand to prevent hunger. This may take some time. Do a fire line with your flamethrower of at least four flames horizontally with no cops nearby (or they begin to chase you). Keep watching the fire, centering by using the R3 camera view, trying not to move CJ only if necessary. If the fire truck arrives to extinguish the fire, repeat this until you get a whirlwind of fire of a decent size. When you get it, it cannot be extinguished. If you keep it centered with the R3 camera view and watch, after awhile the fire truck leaves the fire alone. The fire physics are strange, but if you move the Right Analog-stick slowly and walk just a little bit, you can aim the fire. Keep doing this and you can move it in a certain direction. Do not worry if the flames are close to you, they do not cause damage until you move CJ to the flames. If there are pedestrians walking to the flames ,they will not suffer any damage, even though they do not runaway .However, vehicles can take damage. To make them explode they must be stopped for a certain period of time. Try it on traffic lights or when another vehicle is blocking the path. This is particularly useful on highways where cars travel at high speed. There are multiple wrecks and you can wait to watch them all explode . You will not get a wanted level for doing this.

Fail the mission intentionally, then find the train that they where on. Instead of gang members, you will see instead see floating guns that move and fire at you; they are invincible.

Flying fish 
Get a rocket or grenade launcher and go near a river or beach with fish. Shoot the fish with a rocket or grenade. The fish will fly out of the water and swim around in mid air.

Go to any beach area. Swim a little bit underwater to find a school of fish, dolphin, or turtle in the shallow parts. Get back to the beach where you are neck deep in the water, but still able to use a weapon. Aim the rocket launcher in the part of water where you last saw the aforementioned aquatic life. Fire off a few rockets. If all goes well, you should see a splash on the surface of the water and whatever you shot will come out and start flying around in the air.

Pose for the camera 
This trick can be done at any time in the game. First, make sure your camera is in your hand. While running, quickly tap R1 to aim, but do not release the Left Analog-stick. If done correctly, CJ will be in a running stance, but will be completely still. You can rotate the Left Analog-stick during this time, and he will pivot on one foot.

Flying Tanker 
Steal a Tractor, and grab onto a Tanker (tractor-trailer truck/18 wheeler). Back up to the front of the Tanker and latch on to it. Drive forward, then turn sharply into circles. The Tanker should go flying through the air. This may require several attempts.

Freeze game 
While driving the Vortex hovercraft on land, if you are do a power-slide and Triangle or R2, the game may freeze, and you will lose all unsaved information. Try not to press R2, L2, or Triangle until completely stopped, and facing forward.

Misspelling in Los Santos 
In Downtown Los Santos, there is an Atrium. (you fight inside it in Big Smoke's mission, Just Business). There are two entrances; a front and a side. When you enter the front door, the corner display correctly shows "Atrium". However, if you enter the side door, the corner display shows that you entered the "Attrium".

Jump through window in Las Venturas 
Near the safehouse where your girlfriend Millie lives (directly east from the Abandoned AC Tower; costs $50,000) are windows that you can jump through. Climb the wall beside the house and jump on the roof. You can go through the windows. You can see your garage, shoot people through the window, and if you get a wanted level of 2 or more, can get policemen trapped in your garage. Be careful; when you jump through the window and want to get out you must step back from the window and jump until you can cling onto it, then climb back up.

Wrong casino name in Las Venturas 
Check the map that was included with the game. Look in Las Venturas near the casino entitled "The Clown's Pocket." This casino cannot be found, because it is named "The Ringmaster" on this map. However, in the game it is called "The Clown's Pocket."

CJ spontaneously combusts in Whetstone 
Go to the level area of ground at the peak of Mt. Chiliad, where the mountain bike race is located. Take out a rocket launcher. Aim at the Mountain Bike. The green reticule will home in on the bike. Fire at the bike and blow it up. Then, aim at the bike again, manually. Note: The second time around, the reticule will not automatically aim on the "wreckage" of the bike. When you fire a second missile at the bike, CJ will catch fire. You can be 30 feet away and still catch fire. Also, the same effect has occurs when firing a missile at the bike to "blow it up", then shooting it with a sniper rifle. However when using the rifle it will usually require two or three rounds before CJ catches on fire.

Feet appear through bottom of car 
Enter a car and enable the "Spawn Jetpack" code. Your feet will appear through the bottom of the car. This also works with planes and helicopters. With bikes, CJ will appear to be standing up on the bike.

Bicycle catches on fire 
If a bicycle is upside down, it will catch on fire. However, it is very difficult to get bicycle to stay upside down.

Lowrider remains in position 
Get a lowrider with hydraulics. Put the car in any hydraulic position desired. While holding the car in that direction, press Triangle to get out. You can see the car remain that way. For example, have the back of the car raised in the air.

Lowrider lights 
When in a lowrider at night, look at the headlights and bounce the car up and down. Notice that the lights on the ground stay in one location while the lights on the car move up and down.

Buy hotdogs from dead vendor in Los Santos 
Go to the end of the pier with a Ferris wheel. Enable the "Weapons" code and obtain a rocket launcher. Find the hot dog stand at the far end. Shoot it with a rocket launcher. Jump in the water under the pier, and you should see the stand floating in the water. You can still buy hotdogs, even the vendor is dead.

Wrong restaurant name 
Go to the Cluckin' Bell. Take out a sniper rifle and look at the cups hanging on the wall. They say "Burger Shot".

Wrong dialogue in Los Santos 
During the Reuniting The Families mission, the police helicopter announces that they are the "Los Angeles Police Department" instead of the "Los Santos Police Department".

Camera in Los Santos 
Go in CJ's bedroom. There will be a camera beside the bed. Also, once you complete a certain mission, there will also be a can of spray paint in there.

Reaching other cities early 
Hijack the train. The easiest way to do this is when it is at one of the stations. Then, drive it full speed to the bridges to the other islands. You may need to use the entire city to pick up enough speed. Also, you must be careful around sharp turns. The train will de-rail. Note: This was done with the freight train. When you approach the bridge at the edge of the city, you will slow down, even if you are going very fast. The train will pass through the barricade, as if it were a ghost. You will get a four star wanted level. There is a police bribe on the train tracks in the second city that you will pick up if you pass by it on the train, but your wanted level will immediately jump back to four stars. Also, the train is bullet proof. You cannot die from bullets when inside the train.

When in Los Santos, you will find that all bridges to the other two regions will be blocked by blockades. Sometimes if you try to go through the blockade at high speed with a fast vehicle, it will go through and glitch, along with the AI vehicles that are following.

Enable the "Wanted level never increases" and "Flying car" codes. You can now go to all of San Andreas without the four star wanted level appearing. Note: This must be done again every time you load a saved game. Also, if you shoot cops with the "Wanted level never increases" code enabled, some cops will get out and walk away but others will fire their guns at you.

Enable the "Drive on water" code or swim across the ocean to where you want to go. You will automatically get a four star wanted level when coming ashore in Las Ventruas and a five star wanted level for coming ashore in San Fierro. These stars will not go away with the "Lower wanted level" code, but will disappear when you leave the city.

The following is a multi-step process which may take some time to get correct. Get the parachute located on top of the very tall building a few blocks from the police station in downtown Los Santos. The building is shaped circular inside and "L" shaped on your map. Walk around to the northeast corner of the circular building and step into the yellow triangle to get the parachute that is on the roof. Take it, and keep it (do not switch to a weapon). Go back down and get armor from the police station. It is nearby and has two sets. Do not draw a weapon in the station or you will get a two star wanted level. Next, get the jet at LSX, the airport at Los Santos. Drive up to the gate, climb up on your car, and onto the guard booth, and climb over into the airport. Walk back around to the gate. It will open, and you can get your car and drive back in. Then, find the jet. It is called the Shamal and is located at the end of the runway. Take off and get some practice flying, diving, climbing, rolling, etc. Next, choose a location on your map that you want to go. You can press Circle on the map screen to pin that location on the radar. For example, choose the Binco store in Las Venturas. It is next to the Las Venturas airport and the highway. Once you pass the city line, you will get four stars on your wanted meter. Because you are in the air, they will try to shoot you down with missiles. Notice the two red blips on your radar that are fast approaching. Dive, climb, and roll and the missiles will miss. Do not forget to keep your eye on your target. Once you are over your target and are very high, press Triangle to exit the plane. You will drop straight down. You must be high enough for your parachute to open or you die when you hit the ground. When you are safely on the ground, start running. If you chose to go to Binco or another store, notice that you can go inside and buy clothes. If you buy clothes, you will get rid of the four stars wanted level, as long as you remain in the store. Once you step outside, the four stars will return to your wanted meter.

Reach other cities early in Los Santos 
Use the following trick to get to the other cities before their freeway entrances are actually open. Go to any bridge that connects the start of city of Los Santos to any of the closed cities. Jump into the water that is under that bridge and swim across. When you get far enough, you will have a four star wanted rating. Once you get on land, get a vehicle as soon as possible. Note: You cannot use bribe icons or the Pay N' Spray to decrease this wanted rating.

Reach Las Venturas early in San Fierro 
When you get to San Fierro, go to the shore and travel until you see the Golden Gate Bridge. Enable the "Drive on water" and "Spawn Rhino" codes. Get in the tank and find a way off of the shore. Drive until you get to Las Venturas, and drive onto land. When you get there, you will have a four star wanted meter. Explore the city, and when the police cars hit you, they should explode. Once you are done exploring, drive back into the water or swim back. The area you just explored should be on your map. Note: You cannot buy any property while invading the city. This trick can also be done to explore San Fierro early from Los Santos.

Fly plane without pilot license 
Go to either Los Santos or Las Vatos airport. Go to the place that you would enter if you had a pilot license. If you try to get in the gate, it will say you cannot unless you have the license. Next to the gate is a small building. You will need a small car or any type of bike (BMX, bike, motorcycles, etc.). Stand on top of it and jump on top of the building. Jump off and you should see a fence (at Los Santos Airport). Climb the fence and you will see a Dodo plane. Also, if you follow the runway east, you will see a small jet that is unlocked. At Las Vatos, follow the same procedure. After you jump off of the building, just walk around and look for a plane. Note: All but one of the aircraft at San Fereno's airport are locked.

After using the "Fly plane without pilot license" trick at the Los Santos airport, go forward you should see a Dodo airplane. Get in and take a right when inside the plane. Go straight, then take a right at the runway. Go down it until you see a jet on the right. It is not on the runway. You can get out of the Dodo and get in the jet. You can now fly the jet wherever desired. However, be careful -- if you go out of your territory you will get four stars and jets will shoot missiles at you. Try to dodge them if possible.

Go to the Los Santos airport and get to the place that you would enter if you had a pilot license. If you try to get in the gate, it will say you cannot unless you have the license. Next to the gate is a small building. You will need a small car or any type of bike (BMX, bike, motorcycles, etc.). Stand on top of it and jump on top of the building. After you jump off of the building, just walk around and look for a plane.

To get into the Los Santos airport without a pilots license go all the way south until you reach a tunnel. On the south side of the tunnel, look along the fence line of the airport. Notice how the sidewalk has an incline. Walk up the incline and climb up the ledge where the bottom of the fence starts. Turn towards the ramp sign and jump across. You should grab onto the sign. Then, climb up on top of it, turn towards the fence, and jump. You should jump across and grab the fence. CJ will pull himself up and over, and you will be in the airport.

To access Los Santos International airport early, get a large van and hop over the fence where the guard tells you that you need a pilots license. You can also get any car and hop over the fence around the corner from the guard. Once inside, you will have to hop another fence, then you will find a Dodo. If you go a little further inside near the runway, you will find a jet.

Next to the gate is a small building. You will need a small car or any type of bike (BMX, bike, motorcycles, etc.). Stand on top of it and jump on top of the building. After you jump off of the building, just walk around and look for a plane.

Walk up to the airport gate in San Fierro, touching it. Then, walk along the side of the gate into the corner were the fence bends (keeping in contact with the gate) and walk back into the middle of the gate. It will slide open. You must start in the middle and walk to whichever side the gate will slide open to. For example, if the gates on the left, walk to the left. If it does not work at first, keep trying.

Parachute in Los Santos 
In the Downtown area (near the three way highway section and the red line where the train is passing on your map), you will see a tall circular building with blue/white glass windows. The entrance (with the yellow triangle) is just in the front of it. Enter it, and you will go to the roof of the building where you can find a parachute. Take it, jump down from the roof, and press Circle to open the parachute. Use the Left Analog-stick to control it. Note: You must wait a short time until the parachute respawns back on the roof.

In the Downtown area, there is a skyscraper near the overpass with three triangular columns in front of the corner entrance. Across the street is a building with circular structures around the windows and facing west at the end of the street, a building with a yellow "gems" billboard on top. Enter the skyscraper and go up the stairs. You will see the parachute. If you want to try it, jump off the building and press Circle. Note: Each parachute is good for one jump only.

Go to the police station in the Downtown area. At the doors, you will see a yellow upside down triangle. When you walk in it, you will see a flight of stairs. Go up them and look to the left. You will see a parachute backpack. Walk to it and make sure your weapon display shows the backpack. When you confirm that it is there, jump off and press Circle. The parachute will open. Use the Left Analog-stick to steer yourself left or right or slow down. You can wait until you are lower before opening it. If you wait too long, the parachute will not open in time and you will die.

Parachute in San Fierro 
Go to the Downtown area. Find the very big building. Out front, there a sign that reads "No base jumping". Go to the yellow triangle and you will go to the top. You will automatically get a parachute. This jump lets you fall a long way before opening the parachute. Note: You can only jump once, unless you die.

After you unlock Mt. Chiliad in the Whetstone area, take a Sanchez to the top of the mountain. Once at the very top, look for a mobile home, and a van. Behind them is a parachute. Pick it up, then look for the ramp by the flag. Driver very fast and jump off. After a few seconds in the air, jump off the bike, then press Circle to deploy your parachute, or you can wait to do some free falling. You can also jump off of some high buildings, and out of airplanes.

There is another parachute on the top of the mountain (by the two vehicles). You can fly the Dodo up there, take off, and jump out of the plane whenever you desire. Just press Circle and the parachute will open. By the time you get back to the mountain, another parachute will have respawned. Note: Sometimes when you jump out of the plane, it will not explode, even from that altitude.

Unless you have a license, do the "Fly plane without pilot license" trick to get a plane or helicopter early. Fly to the top of Mt. Chiliad. On the east side where campers are parked, there will be rocks. There should be a parachute on those rocks.

If you ride to the top of Mt. Chiliad, you will find yet another parachute location as well as a Bmx bike race marathon as well as a speed ramp which you can use to fly of the mountain if desired.

Use the Jetpack to reach the very top of the northernmost tower of the bridge leading from San Fierro to Tierra Robada to find a parachute to skydive with.

Skydiving 
Go to any airport. Look for a yellow arrow at the entrances of the airport where you can buy a ticket to another city. Buy the ticket and start the flight. Do not press X and skip the flight. Wait for the airplane to take off and get high in the air. Press Triangle and CJ will jump out of the airplane with a parachute and begin skydiving. When you want to open the parachute, press Circle and float down. There are also other places you can skydive, such as the tall building in the Downtown area of Los Santos, and off the top of Mt. Chiliad. Additionally, to get a parachute very easily, get into any type of flying vehicle, except the Jetpack. You will instantly receive a parachute. If you fly high into the air, then jump out of your plane or helicopter, the parachute will automatically be switched into your weapon inventory.

Skydive longer 
Enable the "Cars fly away" code. Go to any airport and hit any aircraft. Then, enter that craft. All you have to do is steer. Soon the height meter will just stay up. You will get to fly higher than normal when you do this. Fly as high as you desired, then Jump out for a long trip back to earth.

To get better handling on street bikes, get on one and enable the "Spawn Jetpack" code. You will be able to make turns at full speed without crashing. Note: The Jetpack will disappear when you get off the bike.

Longer stoppie time bonus 
Take a BMX and gain some speed. Immediately hold Square followed by Left Analog-stick Forward. Keep them held. If done correctly, the bicycle will be balanced on front wheel. You can also release Square and Left Analog-stick and the bicycle will remain in that position. You can use this trick to take the stoppie bonus for the maximum time as desired. Note: The distance covered in this trick will be less.

Exceed garage limit 
When you want to park a car in a garage but the game states that you cannot store another vehicle, you drive the car near the garage and get out. Then, hop in the car and drive in.

Finding your car after getting busted 
If you been arrested, go down to the police parking lot. Walk around without a weapon. Eventually, you will find your car.

Stealing locked cars 
Some cars have locked doors so you cannot steal them (such as cop cars and your first girlfriend's Hustler). However, getting them into a garage will unlock the doors. You can either push a car into the garage or get a Tow Truck or a Tractor to tow them. Additionally, to get in a locked vehicle with someone inside (for example, a Combine Harvester), shoot the person in the head and the door will fling open, allowing you drive it away.

Find a Tow Truck (for example, at the dump in Mt. Chiliad) and drive to where the locked car is located. Hook the locked car onto the Tow Truck and tow it into your garage. Let the garage close. When you open the garage again, the locked car should be unlocked. This is easier then pushing it into your garage.

If you try to open a car and it is locked, go far from it, then return. The color of the car should be different and the doors should be unlocked.

If someone has locked their car doors, and you shoot them out, be careful not to get out before you reach your garage. Otherwise, the doors will stay locked.

Keep aircraft from races 
Enter the races at the Las Venturas Airport. Select the race with the airplane you desire, then ignore the race and instead take it back to your airstrip and park it in your own big hangar. You will fail the mission, but can re-do it. Once you get back to your airstrip and look in your hanger, your airplane will be there. Save the game to keep it.

Amphibious car 
Enable the "Flying cars" and "Maximum lung capacity" codes. Get a car and go in water. Press R1 to turn the vehicle.

Recommended hydraulic cars 
The Landstalker and Tahoma are by far one of the highest bouncing vehicles on the game (with lots of practice). If you cannot find one of tem on the streets with hydraulics, take one to the Loco shop.

In the House Party mission, your hood gets attacked by the Ballas. They will arrive in two Tahoma. Successfully complete the mission without getting too far away from the cars. Then, push either or both Tahomas into the garage of the Johnson house.

Tampa 
Go to the Jefferson Motel in the Jefferson area of Los Santos. Go west to the split in the road then go on the road to the left. Immediately afterwards you can see a lot on the left decorated with triangular banners and surrounded with a fence. This is the Coutt and Shutz dealership. A Tampa will be in the lot, along with a Clover and Perennial. If none of those cars are there, drive around and the cars will spawn there.

Tow Truck 
Enter the dump at Mt. Chiliad to find a Tow Truck. You can steal cars with it by using the Right Analog-stick to lower the hitch, then back up to a car. Raise the car with the Right Analog-stick and drive away. This can be done while the driver and passenger of the other car are still inside.

Tractor 
As done with the Tow Truck, you can also tow cars with a tractor. Steal one from a farmer, back into another car, then press the Right Analog-stick Back to lift the winch.

Train derailment 
Look at your map and locate the nearest train station. Mark it and go to the train station. Wait for a train to stop in front of you. When it stops, go to the front of it and press Triangle to hijack it. Once inside, hold X to go forward. Once you start going fast enough, your controller will start to vibrate. Keep holding X and eventually you will derail in slow motion, and either flip over or glide to a screeching halt.

Turismo 
In the Breaking the Bank at Caligula's mission, after you have the parachute intentionally miss the helipad and instead aim for the ground. On the ground, almost everyone will be driving a Turismo (the fastest car in the game). Steal one and go to the airstrip. Park the Turismo in the garage and finish the mission. Alternately, collect 20 vehicles for the Import/Export dock to get the Turismo.

Vortex 
Look in one of the buildings at the Panopticon area in Red County. On your map, it will show a brown square with a group of white dots in it. The white dot that is farthest north on the map is the building with the Vortex in it. Alternately, collect 25 vehicles for the Import/Export dock to unlock the Vortex.

Jetpack powered Vortex 
Jump into any body of water and enable the "Spawn Jetpack" code. Then, enable the "Spawn Vortex" code. Get into the Votex and it will be jet powered. Note: Once you leave the Vortex this effect will end.

Flying Vortex 
Go to the top of Mt. Chiliad, where there is a Camper and Journey. It is an open area. Enable the "Spawn Vortex" code, then just drive off and hold X. You cannot move up or down, but can steer it.

Note: This trick does not always work. Go to the tall building in Los Santos that has the parachute on top. Go to the top of that building and enable the "Spawn Vortex" code. Drive it off the top and pull back. It will glide down smoothly to the ground.

Windsor 
Collect 10 vehicles for the Import/Export dock to unlock the Windsor.

Missions Tip's Tricks & Cheats

 


8-Track mission 
Enable the "Slow motion" code and you will be able to easily take first place. This is helpful if you are trying to get the Monster Truck.

Air Raid mission 
Enable the "Slow motion" code to get a better shot at the RC planes. Enable the "Destroy all cars" code repeatedly to pass the mission.

Are You Going To San Fierro? mission 
Instead of burning the weed with the flamethrower, use the rocket launcher and shoot the crops; it will destroy them much easier.

Badlands mission 
Get to the mountain top and blow up the snitch's car. He will jump off the side of the mountain, committing suicide. Enable the "Spawn Jetpack" code and go down there. Take a picture of him. Take the picture back to the drop point. By doing this, you will not have to chase him back down the mountain on the dirtbike. Additionally, enable the "Spawn Jetpack" code. Fly up the mountain, near the top of the cabin. Do not let the guards see you. Choose the silenced pistol. Enter through the back of the cabin and shoot the snitch. Be prepared to fight it out with the FBI if you get caught. You can now snap a photo of the dead snitch without chasing him. It is important to watch the guards' movement before attempting this.

Beat The Cock mission 
This is a triathlon. Go to Santa Maria beach in Los Santos and wait until the weekend (press L1 to see the current day). Then, go to the lighthouse. You will see a little red marker which will start the mission. Note: You must be in very good shape to win. The reward is $10,000. Also, next to Palomino Creek is a beach that is part of Fisher's Lagoon. The one attached to that is part of Palomino Creek (if you are looking on a map it is the second largest of them all, and has a dock). Go to it. On there will be a red circle. Enter it to start the mission. You should have full muscle and stamina because it is a swimming race. If you have good stats, you will complete the mission.

Big Smoke mission 
Instead of holding X to pedal your bike to get away from the red Ballas car, tap X rapidly. CJ will stand and pump on the pedals, allowing you to ride faster, and keep up with Sweet on the uphill areas.

Black Project mission 
This mission starts after a number of Torino missions. Truth is upset with you working with Torino. He abandons you on a road. You are getting into Area 69 and must bring back the Black Project. You must go to the control tower and open the blast doors. You have to avoid the searchlights, but not shoot out more than two of them. You have thermal goggles to see the guards. You must get in before 5:30 a.m. You will begin near body armor if you do not have any. There are guards at mid-level on all of the light towers, plus many that are walking around. Try sniping everybody so that you are not spotted. If you do get spotted, you are told to use a vent to get into the building. In any case, there is armor up on the control tower to replenish with, and a red spot to use to open up the blast doors. The blast doors are in the center of the mound. The vent is marked nearby and you can shoot your way in through the grates. There is a health waiting for you inside that room (with the blast doors on the other wall). Go through the hallway and shoot the guards at the other end. There is armor up and to the right in here. There is also a minigun there. This area has bulletproof glass, so you are safe. Go downstairs to the little opening (not the red path to the left). Shoot out more guards in here. At the end of the path is armor. Then, take a right and another right and you can see a radar room. Disable the SAM site. Then, go downstairs and over to the yellow striped area. There is a grate below you. Go to the end where the grate is up and go in for the health and armor that is down there. Move along, as there are more enemies to kill. Then move left -- they say that there is a keycard. Get the armor then touch the scientist to get his keycard. Follow him down the path to the left and you will be in a giant cylinder building. Work your way down all of the stairs, shooting as you go. Get the Jetpack and fly out, heading for the triangle. You can fire a weapon while flying, but you really do not have to. Truth takes it from you, takes off, and abandons you there.

Body Harvest mission 
Take a bike to the farm and ride to the back of the farm using an indirect route, bypassing the survivalists in the fields and tractors. Quickly steal the harvester, then run over the survivalists that are on foot between you and the road back. Try to overturn the pickups that are in your way. If they are still following you on the road, do a drive by when one is next to you to kill the gunman on the truck bed. The Harvester can take quite a bit of damage. Hit the pickup until it catches on fire, then get away.

Burglary missions 
In the Ganton area of Los Santos, go towards the gym that is just a block south of the Binco store and the bar. Across the street from the gym and to the south, you should see a van parked next to a house. It is a boxcar. After 20:00, jump in and you can go on burglary missions until sunrise.

Go to CJ's garage in San Fierro. Look behind it, and there should be a construction site. Behind the structures of broken down buildings in front of you, there should be an abandoned building with a lop-sided sign that reads "Harry Plumbs" just north of the "Turning Tricks Advanced Driving School". Look to the right of that building to find an alleyway. Walk into the alleyway and look to the right. There should be a black van parked there. Get in sometime before 20:00 and find a nice house you think will make a nice profit. Wait until 20:00, then press R3. You can now do burglary missions until 06:00. Note: When dropping off the cargo, you will return to the garage next to the alleyway that you found the van at.

Steal any burglary van you know of, and travel to any city of your choice. Proceed as usual, and after you have steak the goods, a yellow blip will appear on your map. Pause game play and look at the map. You will see that the blip has jumped from the city you stole the van in, to the city you are currently at. For example, if you steal the van in Los Santos and go to Las Venturas and trigger the burglary missions, the yellow blip will appear in las Venturas, close behind "The Camel's Toe" Casino.

To commit burglaries in San Fierro, go to the Doherty area. Go to the building that has a big sign board, reading "Hairy Plumbs". It is opposite the driving school. Go around the back of the building to find the van.

Infinite time in Burglary missions 
Enable the "Always 21:00" code, then find the van. Additionally, enable the "Always 21:00" and "Wanted level never increases" codes. Find a Boxville and initiate a burglary mission. You should now have as much time as desired to do the mission, and the cops will never chase you if you wake up the people in the houses.

Catalyst mission 
When you reach the train, do not bother getting out of your car. Drive around the pinned down Groves and run into the Vagos. Drive into the train tunnel to turn around if needed. After all the ones on the ground are killed, exit the car and shoot the one on the train. Then, get back into your car and run over the arriving Ballas. If your car begins smoking, park it next to the Ballas car to create an explosion that should kill them all. Then, get on the train as instructed. Quickly toss the ammo crates to Ryder. There is an unlimited number of them onboard so you do not have to waste time getting a perfect target. You may want to change the "Invert Look Controls" setting to make this less confusing. Remember to change the setting back after all the crates are tossed.

Cleaning The Hood mission 
Do not bother using fighting moves on the crack dealer outside. A single shot from your pistol will bring him down. Once inside the crack den, use the pistol again to take down the targets quickly. Note: Shoot the man with the bat first.

Cop Wheels mission 
Any police motorcycles will not work. You must steal the ones that the game marks for you.

Da Nang Thang mission 
When the helicopter gets shot down and you are in the water, do not swim to the ship. Instead, swim to shore, steal a car, and drive to Ammu-Nation to buy weapons and armor. Then, go to the ship. The mission is a lot easier with an AK-47 in your inventory.

Drive-By mission 
After approaching each group of targets, just continue to drive around the block normally. There is no reason to damage your car trying to reverse or spin back around. The targets do not run far. Simply drive normally around the block until your partners can start shooting them again. With the last group of Balla's, drive your car down the path and through the tunnel to run them over. Turn around and repeat until they are all dead. Note: Since this mission is not timed, you can drive carefully to a Pay N' Spray between drive-bys to get your car's health bar restored. You will eventually have to go to the Pay N' Spray anyway at the end of the mission to lower your wanted level. Note: That visit will be complimentary, but any others will be charged.

Drive Thru mission 
Try to get in front of the Ballas car and trap it into a wall or building. Your partners will shoot it until it catches on fire. Get your car away from it before it explodes. Additionally, after getting the background of the mission, drive back to Grove Street and get the bazooka. Aim at the exit for Grove street. When the Ballas car is coming, shoot at it to quickly finish the mission.

Explosive Situation mission 
Go into the quarry and shoot the two workers that are featured the opening sequence at the detonation controls. This will stop the countdown and you can take your time getting the dynamite. Run over the dynamite crates with the giant dump truck to beak them open and get the explosives.

Farewell My Love mission 
As the race begins, instead of going forward, turn around and go straight. You will be jumping off a cliff, but if you can land your car successfully you will be on your way. Keep driving straight into the town. Take a right turn at the first right you see. If you have already done the race you should know where to go. Follow the road and take another right. You will then be driving across a small bridge. Turn left on the small dirt road and park your car at the end of the bridge. Since you are allowed only 25 seconds out of your car, you must do this quickly. Once out of your car, run to the middle of the bridge. Enable the "Spawn Rhino" code, which should block the bridge. Do this as many times as desired, but be aware that the other cars will show up sometime around three minutes. When the cars appear, make sure to have the rocket launcher out before getting in your car. When the cars show up, they will drive into the creek/river. Quickly get out of your car and fire multiple rockets at them. Do this very quickly. You can then complete the race with no competitors. Additionally, before the race starts, enable the "Flying cars" code. Go to the race. Immediately at the start of the race, all cars will floor it and will fly off the cliff. This gives you as much time as needed to complete the race. Make sure you go drive slow so that you also do not fly off. About six minutes are required to complete the race.

Fender Ketchup mission 
To easily complete this mission, find a large empty area and just keep going fast back and forth doing a lot of 180 degree turns to get the scare-o-meter full. Watch out for cops -- once they spot you, you will have more then one star and they will try to hit you head on. Remember to make sure that you do not get in a head on collision, or the man on the hood will die. Additionally, do not drive on the freeway, as this will attract the police. Instead, drive to the airport and perform a few insane jumps. This will have him terrified quickly. Also, the airport is not too far from Woozie's casino. Pull to the side of Woozie's casino and drive back and forth doing 180s until the Scare-O-Meter is full.

High Stakes, Low Rider mission 
Instead of using the first lowrider that was given you by Cesar, drive any vehicle to Cesar's house. Look across the street from the mission starting circle to find a light colored Voodoo in a driveway. Get in it, and use it to start the mission. This car is considered a low rider, but does not have hydraulics making it less likely that you will accidentally activate them. It also controls better in turns when compared to your original lowrider. Get to the starting position of the race. When the race begins, try to maneuver around the inevitable initial crash of most of the other drivers. Note that the waypoint markers for races now are visible on the horizon, unlike the "bubble" markers of previous Grand Theft Auto games. Also, imbedded in the waypoint marker is an arrow that will indicate the direction that you need to follow for the next marker. It may be easier to slip into second place and watch the first place cars for cues on where to turn. Otherwise, just pay attention to the directions and take your turns carefully when in first place. By the time you reach the final waypoint markers, slip into first place, or use the final straight away to take the lead. Do not slow down at the end, even though the road stops. Hit the finish line at full speed. Additionally, when you get in the low rider, enable the "Deadly vehicle" code. During the race, tap the rear bumper of each car in front of you. By the end of the race, you will have as much time as needed to finish in first place without any competition.

Enable the "Flying cars" code before you get to the starting grid. When the race begins, the five other low-riders will start to fly around the area. When you reach the third or fourth checkpoint, you will be in first place throughout the race. Do not accelerate fast, because you will also end up flying. Instead, drive at a very slow pace, but fast enough so that you can finish the race before the game freezes.

Bulletproof Savanna in High Stakes, Low Rider mission 
After completing the mission, Cesar and his Savanna will remain at the finish line, but the doors will be locked. Use another vehicle to push the car to your garage. The doors will now be unlocked and the car remains bulletproof.

Home Invasion mission 
Try to get to the target house with as much time remaining. The required three ammunition boxes can be found in the following locations. In the first room that you enter, look to your right near the cannon next to the front window. Go up the stairs and look on the landing. Go all the way up the stairs and go to the end of the hallway. If desired, you can get three more boxes in the house, but they do not seem to give anything extra.

Ice Cold Killa mission 
Take a gun and shoot out the tires of the pimpmobile. Then, shoot the car until the smoke turns black. Next, get a gun that you can do drive bys with. If you do not have one, go behind the building and by a pole for the bridge to find one. When you get into the club through the windows, meet Jizzy and just run out of the club after him. When you are out there, the pimpmobile should be in the same condition that you left it. It is easier to blow up his car. Additionally, before you go into the club, shoot out the tires of his Pimpmobile. Get in the club, chase him out, and he will get into the car even with blown tires. You just run after him, and pull him out of the car.

Outside the club are two limos along with Jizzy's car. Before entering the club through the skylight, park one limo in front of his car and the other behind his car, blocking it in. It will remain this way when Jizzy exits the club and tries to escape, making it easy to run up and pull him out of the car before he can drive off. Also, "high center" Jizzy's car on the grassy median along the boardwalk prior to entering the club. He will not be able to drive off it before you reach the car to pull him out. Additionally, before entering the club, blow up Jizzy's car rather than just shooting off the tires or decreasing its health. Then when Jizzy tries to escape, he will be forced to do so in a Pizzaboy scooter. Just knock him off his bike and kill him with an M4 or any other gun.

Instead of trying to get out and get in jizzy's car, just follow him for awhile. He will get out of the car, and you can shoot him.

Just Business mission 
On the first part, let Sweet do all the shooting. When on the motorcycle unleash your guns on the people on motorcycles going for the person driving. If he dies they both do. You can also try to pop their tires. They will spin out. Do not worry about the big truck you see -- it is indestructible. You will see the action play out of you going of the car. You will jump off the big truck from the trailer.

Key To Her Heart mission 
In the Key To Her Heart mission for Woozie in Las Venturas, when you go to the courtier's house and kill the gimp, you can take his purple dildo to use as a melee weapon. Additionally, when you get Millie as a girlfriend, instead of dating her, kill her. Wait awhile and Woozie will call. CJ will say that Millie is dead. Woozie will tell you to go to her house and take the pass key.

Strange T-Bone behavior in Mike Toreno mission 
In the mission, when instructed to get into the car and doing so, you can choose any car desired. Get out and choose a faster vehicle with T-Bone following you. T-Bone's following actions for entering and exiting vehicles are scripted strangely. For example, if you crash and get thrown off a motorcycle with T-Bone on it with you, he will get up and walk to any nearby vehicle door, and then follow you.

Misappropriation mission 
Instead of chasing the man in the helicopter, enable the "Spawn Jetpack" code. Fly up behind the man. Make sure he does not see you then open fire from the Jetpack. Swoop in, grab the dossier, then make your escape before the FBI kills you.

Mountain Cloud Boys mission 
This mission seems difficult at first, but if you have the correct weapons it can be easy. First, enable the "Weapons (tier 3)" code to get the rocket launcher. Next, enable the "Deadly vehicle" code. When the men come after you, shoot the first two or three with a gun. Get ahead of Woozie and shoot a rocket at the car to blow it up, killing everyone there. As you go further, two motorcycles will pull up. Hit them with the rocket launcher. Be careful; make sure that the bike blows up before getting too close. As you go further into the alley, you can shoot rockets in the directions of enemies with guns and kill them all, but stay ahead of Woozie. When you and Woozie jump in the car (having the "Deadly vehicle" code enabled), just hit the two cars head on, but be careful. Your car can be damaged and explode as a result of too many hits.

Noon mission 
You must keep ramming him and do the "PIT" maneuver as taught in driving school. His car will come next to you. When it does, shoot him with a drive by. His car will catch on fire and he will get out. He will shoot at you. You must shoot at him first and he will die. Additionally, before you start, get a RPG or a homing rocket launcher. Then, enable the "Cars fly away" code. When you start the mission, get the dune buggy nearby and ram Eddie's car. It will float away slowly, then it will hover. While it is hovering, get out of the dune buggy and shoot him down with the RPG or homing rocket launcher; it will blow up and fall down.

Sometimes when you drive out of the ghost town, at the of the intersection of the dirt road leading out of the ghost town and the road leading to the Sherman Dam, Pulaski will go too fast on the left turn, go wide, and crash into a road sign on the side of the road. Block him and hijack his car. Drive into the water just north of the Sherman Dam. Do not go too fast though, or you will lose Pulaski and fail the mission. Exit the car and just stay in the water. Pulaski will run after you after you steal his car, and end up walking into the water. Pulaski cannot swim, and will drown. You will have killed Pulaski without using cheats or bullets.

Before you start mission, equip a sniper riffle. When the Pulaski runs for the car, aim and zoom in. You will have enough time to flatten the front and the rear tire. Then, hop in the Sand Rail next to the cemetery and follow his car. Watch him; he will be swerving all over the place. This will give you enough time to shoot at the car or pull him out and shoot him.

OG Loc mission 
After getting the PCJ and beginning the chase, it is not necessary to shoot at or try to knock Freddy off his bike. You simply need to follow him. If you lose sight of him, just keeping him in the zoomed version of the mini-map is enough to keep the mission going. Try to follow his path, but if he gets out of sight, you can use parallel streets and paths to continue. Pay attention to whether his position is above or below you (a triangle instead of a square) on the mini-map, and choose the appropriate course. At the end, he will stop at a park in Vagos territory. Ride your PCJ up the stairs past the gang to the top of the structure, then mow them down as they clear the top of the steps. Additionally, if you failed this mission the first time and try it again, you will be prompted to trip skip. This makes you automatically get OG Loc, and end up at the house where you ring the door bell.

Pier 69 mission 
Instead of chasing Ryder in the boat, wait until he approaches in his boat, then enable the "Destroy all cars" code. The mission will be instantly completed.

Billboard message In Reuniting The Families mission 
Along the highway in Los Santos is an advertisement on a billboard. It has a woman on it with a can of pop on the side of her labeled Sprunk. Under that, it reads "A taste of things to come". At the end of the Reuniting The Families mission, your car will go through that billboard, changing the writing at the bottom to read "A taste of come".

Riot mission 
This mission is quite long and requires a lot of ammunition and body armor. You must take over all of the gang territories in the hood areas. Try driving concentric to the Johnson house going outward in one big circle. Once you have established your territory, the mission is complete and you can celebrate with Big Smoke and continue with the other missions.

Robbing Uncle Sam mission 
Before you climb over the gate, get a gun or Uzi and shoot the two soldiers from outside . When you climb over the gate, shoot the guard standing behind two crates . When you enter the warehouse, use the forklift and carry two boxes at a time. Do this by sliding the arms directly into the middle of two boxes. You can now carry both of them at the same time. However, you cannot put two boxes into the truck at the same time . By the time you carry the two boxes behind the truck , one army guard will appear and Ryder will try to kill him. Do not let him kill the guard by himself, as he takes a long time and could lose a lot of health. After you have carried the four boxes to the truck , there will be two boxes outside the warehouse . They can be found at the left hand side of the warehouse, and the other can be found at the place where you killed the third soldier before you entered the warehouse. After when you escape , two army vehicles will start to chase you. If you are lucky, both of them can keep crashing and they will end up exploding.

Before starting the mission, find the TV Studios in the northwest part of Los Santos. At the top of the stairs (in the car park), you will find a sniper rifle. When you start the mission, do not shoot the guard at the gate. Instead, run behind the building that is on your left. Go up the stairs, walk along the pathway, and drop down at the end. Run and climb up the container boxes that are in front of you. You may get shot a few times, but if you are fast, you will survive. Use the sniper rifle to shoot all the guards (do not open the gate yet). After you have opened the warehouse door by shooting the switch on the right and have killed the two guards inside, move the boxes close to the door by using the forklift. Also, move the two boxes outside (which one of the guards was previously using for cover). You can now open the front gate. If you use the sniper rifle, you will not have to keep running around. You should be able to load the boxes quickly while Sweet covers you. Note: Keep an eye on Sweet's health. You may need to stop loading and shoot a few guards if he starts to lose too much health.

Driving and using the forklift can be difficult, especially under fire. Try doing the mission this way. When CJ and Ryder arrive at the Army National Guard weapons depot, you will be told to shoot the gate switch so that Ryder can enter. Do not do that. Instead, jump the wall and kill all the National Guard soldiers (one near the Jeep, and the other that is near the gate switch). Then, shoot the keypad that is on the warehouse, not the front gate. Kill the guardsmen hiding inside the warehouse, then prepare the area for loading. You will only be able to load six crates into the truck before Ryder jumps in the back and tells you to make your getaway. Do not be tempted to bring the other six crates that are scattered around the warehouse to your staging area. Bring the four crates that area in the back of the warehouse to the front and place them closer to the warehouse door opening, on either side. Bring the two crates that are outside the warehouse to the area where you have staged the other four, but leave the last crate you brought on the forklift, and keep it elevated so you can quickly insert it into the truck. The trick to using the forklift is to make sure that the forks are fully lowered. Line yourself up with the crate, drive forward until you hear a rattling noise, then immediately press Right Analog-stick Up. The reason for doing this so quickly is that if you are not perfectly lined up with a crate, it may begin to slip off the forks. Pressing Right Analog-stick Up quickly may prevent the crate from falling off. While you are staging the crates, you may be visited by a guardsman or two. The guardsmen who were at the gate and Jeep will respawn after awhile. While the one near the Jeep will come to give you trouble, the one at the gate usually will not bother you. It is important to not be driving the forklift when a guardsman appears. If he pulls you from the forklift, you will not be busted. However just as soon as you begin to get up he will shoot you. Press L2 + R2 every so often to look behind you. Because you have as much time as needed to stage your crates, try sneaking behind the gate guard and practice your stealth kills. Once you have five crates staged, position the forklift (with the last crate still on it) inside the warehouse, facing the door opening. Then, shoot the gate switch. While Ryder brings the truck in, get back into the forklift to be ready to insert the first crate. While you are loading the truck, Ryder will come under fire. Jump out and help Ryder, as his death will end the mission in failure. When you have loaded six crates into the truck, Ryder will jump in the back and tell you to make your getaway. Finish off any remaining guardsmen, then jump in the truck and drive to the gate. As you near the exit, two Patriots will appear and aggressively intercept you. If you continue to leave the depot, Ryder will (at your command by honking the horn), dump crates at the Patriots in an attempt to thwart the National Guard from stopping you. However, if these explosions kill a cop walking along the way to Emmett's, you will have more attention than needed, as the truck you are driving can be easily tipped over by obstacles you come in contact with. Instead use the following trick and you will have no one bothering you on the way to Emmett's. When the two Patriots appear as you make your way to the gate opening, stop the truck and get out. While the truck is stopped, the Patriots will no longer drive aggressively, and the guards will not leave their vehicles. Use manual aim and shoot the guardsmen in the head while they are seated. Once both Patriots are disabled (drivers and passengers dead), make your way to Emmett's. There is also a glitch in this mission. While you are driving to Emmett's, press L2 + R2 to look behind you. You may see a Patriot that is stopped in the middle of the road. Release the buttons, drive a short distance, and press L2 + R2 again. You will see the same thing, as if the Patriot is following you when you are not looking.

When you pull up to the gate, hop the wall and shoot the guard at the gate. Go and shoot the two other guards by the warehouse, then shoot the keypad next to the door. Kill the men inside the warehouse. Turn back around and another guard will be running towards you. Shoot him, then hop on the forklift and put the crates by the warehouse door where the truck backs up to. Then, get the two crates that are outside and put them by the other ones. Keep one elevated on the forklift. Shoot the keypad on the gate. Get back on the forklift. Put the first crate inside the truck, then get off and kill the soldier attacking Ryder. Then, get another crate and do the same thing. Every time you load one crate, another soldier will appear. Keep getting off the forklift and kill them. This takes some time, but you and Ryder will not get killed. Get back in the truck when Ryder tells you to and leave. The two Patroits that follow you will be easy to get rid of.

After loading the six crates in the truck, before you jump into the van to drive away, run to the stairs where the soldiers were coming from. Take out the rocket launcher. The two Patriots will follow you to the stairs and you can destroy them with the rocket launcher. After taking them out, you will be able to get back safely with out the nuisance of the Patriots chasing after you.

Stowaway mission 
To easily complete this mission, wheelie in a straight line to the right of the plane, getting next to the ramp. When the plane has offloaded the last of its barrels, turn sharply left and go up the ramp. When aboard, it is critical not to use any firearms at all. Even one shot is usually enough to blow you out of the sky. Also, do not plant more than five charges, as they may self-detonate once you pass that amount. Do not detonate the satchel charges until you are standing on the end of the ramp, or you may not get out in time.

Supply Line mission 
First, go after the man on the bike to your left when you take off. Next, swing around and take out the man in the van. Then, head west and take out the other van. This is the easy part. Instead of flying across town to kill the motorbike and the last van, land on a building close to where you started and just remain there. You will not lose any fuel after your model airplane has landed. For some reason, the other two couriers will make their way toward you. Sit patiently until you can get behind the bike (it will reach you first), then land again on a nearby building. The last van may end up on the freeway. You will have a clear shot at him by flying only a few blocks, and you will be close to Zero's shop. Additionally, enable the "Fast motion" code repeatedly (about five times) before entering the red marker to start the mission. Your plane will fly faster, but your fuel will deplete the same rate as if you were in normal time. Also, wait on Zero's roof until the van passes by, by doing this, you will save fuel.

Sweet's Girl mission 
Make sure you have a fast and reliable car in your garage before staring the mission. Quickly drive to the yellow objective marker. Drive your car on the sidewalk to mow down the Ballas. Keep going into the basketball court at the end of the street to turn around and make another pass. If your car starts smoking, quickly park it next to any survivors and bail. The explosion should kill them. Get behind some cover and shoot anyone remaining.

Tagging Up Turf mission 
To spray over the last tag on the upper part of the building, walk to the nearby small fenced in alley. You will be instructed to hold Square to climb it. Do so, cross to the other higher fence and also climb that. Then, climb the short wall, then climb again to the ledge that you can use to walk to the tag.

Tanker Commander mission 
After hooking up the trailer, jump out of the truck. The gas station attendant and a friend will be in a car nearby. It will repeatedly crash into the stationary truck and trailer and become damage. Stay out of the way and shoot the car when it is in a safe position until it catches on fire. The gas station attendant will bail. Shoot him, then get back in the truck and carefully drive it to the destination marker.

Toreno's Last Flight mission 
When you go to take out Toreno, wait until his helicopter's energy bar appears. Then, enable the "Destroy all cars" code.

Up, Up, And Away mission 
Instead of going directly into the military compound and fighting the soldiers, steal a Leviathan from the Las Venturas airport. Land it outside of Woozie's casino. After the mission briefing, fly above the destination marker. You should see a helipad with a Leviathan in the distance. Try to land near the helipad and watch out for two soldiers armed with rocket launchers. Bail out if needed near the helipad. Kill the armed soldiers, shoot down the other helicopters, then finish the mission. Instead of fighting all the soldiers downstairs, all you had to do is kill two men and destroy two helicopters.

Vertical Bird mission 
Your mission is to board the aircraft carrier by jumping off your boat and swimming inside. If you drive your boat into the back of the loading docks of the aircraft carrier, your cover is blown. Run and gun to the radar room and take out the SAM launcher. Afterwards, run to the back of the carrier, and before you take off with the Hydra, blow up two of the three Hydras. Do not destroy the one on the loading elevator, as this is the one you want. Then, take off and you will only have one other Hydra to shoot down with instead of three. After you have taken out the enemy Hydra, sink the three spy boats by hovering your jet instead of flying.

Wrong Side Of The Tracks mission 
Once at the station, do not get on the dirt bike. Instead, enable the "Spawn Jetpack" code, then kill the men on the train with the shotgun. Once you have killed the men on the train, you must go back to Smoke and get on the dirt bike to pass the mission. Additionally, smoke has very bad aim. Try to keep up speed with the train. When Smoke tells too take the hill, do not, as this makes completing the mission almost impossible. Instead, stay with the moving train. Go past the barrier and try to avoid getting hit by the other train. Also, turn off the vibration option on the controller to help keep your hands steady while on the tracks.

Moon World
the Moon world  or "Inside-Out-Town" is where all the interior space's are.
when you Walk in to a yellow marker you Enter a interior space.
all the interior space's are kept in a 3D world or cyber cube.
IF you end up on the "outside" of a interior space's you will see other 
interiors hanging in that dark space.  building or fastfood interiors. 
there may be more then one Moon world in a game.
by using the same interior over & over.  the games data size can be kept low.
a all in one 3D game world would use a lot more data then may fit on a Regular DVD disc.
also there are draw distance problems if you look out a window on to a street.
haveing all the games world moveing inside & out may slow game play.
so separate interiors are used with blanked-out windows.
its all about the way the game is developed,  
GTA VC has all-in-one interiors. for fastfood outlets  but not other buildings.

Hot Coffee
In the summer of 2005
A revelation of a hidden, locked gameplay sequence called "Hot Coffee," 
which was buried deep in the code of GTA San Andreas, 
caused a stir among many US politicians and public figures.
The name refers to narrative leading up to the controversial sequence,
 in which CJ is invited back to a girlfriend's apartment for "coffee." 
The sequence features interactive, 
graphic scenes depicting CJ, engaging in sex with his girlfriend.
Wildenbourg's hack first appeared soon after the release of the 
PC version of GTA SA in June 2005
leading to speculation that the hidden code might also be present in the 
PS2 and Xbox editions of the game.
this led to an extraordinary action by the 
Entertainment Software Rating Board and an unusual financial loss by 
publisher Rockstar Games.
The ESRB's decision to change its rating called on compliant retailers to 
either alter the game's packaging (with new labels or "AO" stickers), or 
to pull the game from their shelves altogether. Meanwhile, 
Rockstar went to work on a new "M"-rated version of San Andreas, 
in which all "Hot Coffee" code would be removed (or immutably disabled).
 two versions of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas would exist. 
The original release, now rated "AO," 
and the newer version with the "Hot Coffee" code completely suppressed, 
rated "M." To anyone who does not purposefully take measures to 
unlock the "Hot Coffee" sequence,
 these two versions will be exactly the same.
