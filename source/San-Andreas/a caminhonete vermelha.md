The red truck has been the uttermost target for many hunters. The directions given www.epsilonprogram.com is clear:

"Travel through the dawn to the pass pictured in our brochures. Look for a red truck with a dent on the right fender. Raise your left hand and recite the words: "Take me to to my father-father, brother-uncle. Kifflom." We'll do the rest. Because we all know, there is Kifflom and there is Krant, and both be praised. Blindfold required.

Most of this directions is very inaccurate. It could be any pass in San Andreas, nobody has found the brochure picturing the pass, CJ cannot raise his arm, he cannot be directed to say what you want him to, and there is no blindfold to found. You can buy an eyepatch from Binco, but this is not a blindfold, since it doesn't blind more than one eye. Also, San Andreas is full of cars dented from traffic accidents that happens around you all the time. There's also the two skin variations of the Glendale and the Sadler, that has the beaten-up look already when they spawn..

All in all this information is very useless, as you really can't use any of it to hunt somthing concrete, maybe except the dented truck. There has been many and thorough searches for this car, but nobody has documented the finding of a car like this, that actually makes anything unusual happen. There's lot's of red and/or dented trucks to be found both parked and driving around all of San Andreas, but the "red truck with a dent on the right fender" is one of the most definite clues, and therefore one of the most hunted. We can be pretty sure that if it really was a truck to be found, someone would have found it already. 

Here's one of the dented trucks, a Sadler, that is placed around in San Andreas. Just like with all the other ones, nothing happens around it, and nothing special happens when you get inside it - it's just another car. Both the Sadler and the Glendale have two skins, one ordinary skin, and one beaten-up skin. If you drive one of the beaten-up cars to a repair shop, it is reset to it's original skin, a beaten-up car, just like you first found it.

As there hasn't been found any red truck - or other kind of car - that seems to be any different from the other cars, there has been found a sign that mght be a hint. In Red County, you'll find a large signpost saying "Truck Terminal Red County", with the word "Truck" and "Red" on top of each other on the left side. If there is any special place you could expect to find the special red truck mentioned on epsilonpogram.com, it might be here.
