First take a look the map that followed your copy of GTA San Andreas. In the lower left area, you will find "The farm" Cult location pointed out. This is the location you visit in the mission "Body harvest".

The special thing about this farm, is that the windows shines with a blue light at night, unlike other buildings in San Andreas. Since blue is the colour of Epsilon, it is believed to confirm that this is the cults meeting place. But there are no signs of activy when you go there, or other interesting objects, it's just the blue light in the windows.

When in Blue Hell, it is possible to see the farm from below ground, and look into the building interiros (Thanks to Manuel for the image).
As you can see, there is nothing in it.
