The ghost cars are situated in Back O' Beyond, and is really nothing more but a couple of beaten-up Glendale cars. There are two different Glendales in the game, one ordinary Glendale, and one with dents and what seems like chainsaw marks (which has been explained as a hint to that Leatherface actually exists in the game). The two ghost cars spawns in the hills in Back O' Beyond, and are therefore rolling down the hills as you spot them. They're not driving by themselves, just rolling down, then stopping. Nothing more weird to that.

A pedestrian is also heard saying this: "My car move by itself when i go shopping.". I don't know if it's related to the ghost cars, or just a fun quote.

Somebody also made this arrangement of Leatherface in front of a line-up of "ghost" Glendales.
It's not a fake, just a creative player having some fun with us:
