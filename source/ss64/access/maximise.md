<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/head_access.lbi" --><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><h1>DoCmd.Maximise</h1>
<p> Enlarge the active window, the current Access form or report.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      DoCmd.Maximise</pre>
<p>When an Access window is maximized, all other windows will also be maximized when you open them or switch to them.</p>
<p>The size of an Access Window will be constrained by the size of the window containing the MS Access application, <i>unless</i> the form is a popup form, in which case it can be moved outside the main window.</p>
<p>Pop-up forms are never maximized. To format a form as a PopUp, set the forms PopUp property to True.</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="code">DoCmd.Maximise</p>
<p class="quote">“We’re not here to leave a mark, bro. Monuments, legacies, marks - that’s where we always go wrong. We’re here to revel in the world, to soak in the awesomeness of it, to enjoy the ride. The world’s maximum perfect as it is, beauty from horizon to horizon. Any mark any of us tries to leave - hell, it’s only graffitti. Any mark anyone leaves is no better than vandalism” ~&nbsp;Dean Koontz</p>
