<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/head_bash.lbi" --><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><h1>mknod</h1> 
<p> Create a FIFO, character special file, or block special file 
with the specified name.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      mknod [<i>options</i>]... <i>NAME </i><i>Type</i> [<i>Major Minor</i>]

Options

 -m <i>MODE</i>
 --mode=<i>MODE</i>
     Set the mode of created files to <i>MODE</i>, which is symbolic as in
     `chmod' and uses 0666 minus the bits set in the umask as the point
     of departure.
<i>
Type</i>    The type of file to make:
  `p'     for a FIFO
  `b'     for a block special file
  `c'     for a character special file
<i>
Major/Minor</i> When making a block or character special file, the major and minor 
            device numbers must be given after the file type.</pre>
<p>Unlike the phrase "special file type" above, the term "special 
  file" has a technical meaning on Unix: something that can generate or receive 
  data. Usually this corresponds to a physical piece of hardware, e.g., a printer 
  or a disk. (These files are typically created at system-configuration time.) 
  The `mknod' command is what creates files of this type. Such devices can be 
  read either a character at a time or a "block" (many characters) at a time, 
  hence we say there are "block special" files and "character special" files.</p>
