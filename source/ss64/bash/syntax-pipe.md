<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><h1>Pipe</h1> 
<p>Redirect the output from one command as input for another.<br>
  A <code>pipeline</code> is a sequence of simple commands separated by <code>`|'</code>. 
</p>
<p>The format for a pipeline is 
</p><pre>[<code>time</code> [<code>-p</code>]] [<code>!</code>] <i>command1</i> [<code>|</code> <i>command2</i> ...]
</pre>
<p>The output of each command in the pipeline is connected to the input of the 
  next command. That is, each command reads the previous command's output. </p>
<p>The reserved word <code>time</code> causes timing statistics to be printed 
  for the pipeline once it finishes. The statistics currently consist of elapsed 
  (wall-clock) time and user and system time consumed by the command's execution. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The <code>`-p'</code> option changes the output format to that specified by 
  POSIX.<br>
  <br>
  The <code>TIMEFORMAT</code> variable can be set to a format string that specifies 
  how the timing information should be displayed. The use of <code>time</code> 
  as a reserved word permits the timing of shell builtins, shell functions, and 
  pipelines. An external <code>time</code> command cannot time these easily. </p>
<p>If the pipeline is not executed asynchronously, the shell waits for all commands 
  in the pipeline to complete. </p>
<p>Each command in a pipeline is executed in its own subshell. The exit status 
  of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command in the pipeline. If the 
  reserved word <code>`!'</code> precedes the pipeline, the exit status is the 
  logical negation of the exit status of the last command. </p>
