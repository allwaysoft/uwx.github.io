-u     When listing partition tables, give sizes in sectors instead of cylinders.</p>
<pre><code>   -l     List the partition tables for /dev/hd[a-d], /dev/sd[a-h], /dev/ed[a-d], and then exit.

<p>Hard  disks  can be divided into one or more logical disks called partitions.  This division is described in the partition table found in sector 0 of the disk.<br>
<br>
In the BSD world one talks about <code>disk slices' and a </code>disklabel'.<br>
<br>
Linux needs at least one partition, namely  for  its  root file  system. It can use swap files and/or swap partitions, but the latter are more efficient. So, usually  one<br>
will  want a second Linux partition dedicated as swap partition.  On Intel compatible hardware, the BIOS that boots
the  system can often only access the first 1024 cylinders of the disk. For this reason people with large disks often create a third partition, just a few MB large, typically mounted on /boot, to store the kernel image and a few auxiliary files needed at boot time, so as to make sure that this stuff is accessible to the BIOS.  </p>
<p>Using more than the minimum number of  partitions can aid with security, ease of administration and backup or testing.<br>
<br>
fdisk  (in  the first form of invocation) is a menu driven program for creation and manipulation of partition tables.<br>
It  understands  DOS  type partition tables and BSD or SUN type disklabels.</p>
<pre>       The device is usually one of the following:
              /dev/hda
              /dev/hdb
              /dev/sda
              /dev/sdb
       (/dev/hd[a-h] for IDE disks, /dev/sd[a-p] for SCSI  disks,
       /dev/ed[a-d] for ESDI disks, /dev/xd[ab] for XT disks).  A
       device name refers to the entire disk.
<pre><code>   The partition is a device name  followed  by  a  partition
   number.   For example, /dev/hda1 is the first partition on
   the first IDE hard disk in the system.  IDE disks can have
   up  to  63  partitions,  SCSI  disks  up  to 15.  See also
   /usr/src/linux/Documentation/devices.txt.

   A BSD/SUN type disklabel can describe  8  partitions,  the
   third of which should be a `whole disk' partition.  Do not
   start a partition that  actually  uses  its  first  sector
   (like  a  swap  partition)  at cylinder 0, since that will
   destroy the disklabel.

   An IRIX/SGI type disklabel can describe 16 partitions, the
   eleventh  of which should be an entire `volume' partition,
   while the ninth should be labeled  `volume  header'.   The
   volume  header  will also cover the partition table, i.e.,
   it starts at block zero and extends by default  over  five
   cylinders.   The  remaining space in the volume header may
   be used by header directory entries.   No  partitions  may
   overlap  with  the  volume header.  Also do not change its
   type and make some file system on it, since you will  lose
   the  partition  table.   Use  this type of label only when
   working with Linux on IRIX/SGI machines or IRIX/SGI  disks
   under Linux.&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>A  DOS type partition table can describe an unlimited number of partitions. In sector 0 there is room for  the description of 4 partitions (called `primary'). One of these can be an extended partition; this is a box  holding logical  partitions,  with  descriptors  found in a linked list of sectors, each preceding the corresponding logical partitions. The four primary partitions, present or not, get numbers 1-4.  Logical partitions start numbering  from 5.<br><br>
In  a DOS type partition table the starting offset and the size of each partition is stored in two ways: as an  absoute  number of sectors (given in 32 bits) and as a Cylinders/Heads/Sectors triple (given in 10+8+6 bits). The former  is  OK - with 512-byte sectors this will work up to 2 TB. The latter has two different problems. First  of  all, these  C/H/S  fields can be filled only when the number of heads and the number of sectors per track are known.  Secondly,  even  if we know what these numbers should be, the 24 bits that are available do not suffice.  DOS uses C/H/S only, Windows uses both, Linux never uses C/H/S.<br>
<br>       
If possible, fdisk will obtain the disk geometry automatically.  This is not necessarily the physical disk geometry (indeed,  modern  disks do not really have anything like a physical geometry, certainly not  something  that  can  be described in simplistic Cylinders/Heads/Sectors form), but is the disk geometry that MS-DOS uses  for  the  partition  table.<br>
<br>Usually  all  goes well by default, and there are no problems if Linux is the only system on the disk. However,  if       
the disk has to be shared with other operating systems, it is often a good idea to let an fdisk from another  operating  system  make at least one partition. When Linux boots<br>
<br>it looks at the partition table, and tries to deduce  what(fake)  geometry  is  required  for  good cooperation with other systems.<br>
<br>Whenever a partition table is printed out,  a  consistency check  is  performed on the partition table entries.  This check verifies that the physical and logical start and end points  are  identical,  and that the partition starts and ends on a cylinder boundary (except for the  first  partition).<br>
<br>
Some  versions  of  MS-DOS  create a first partition which does not begin on a cylinder boundary, but on sector 2  of the  first  cylinder.   Partitions beginning in cylinder 1 cannot begin on a cylinder boundary, but this is  unlikely to  cause difficulty unless you have OS/2 on your machine.<br>
<br>       
A sync() and a BLKRRPART ioctl() (reread  partition  table from disk) are performed before exiting when the partition table has been updated.  Long ago it used to be  necessary to  reboot after the use of fdisk.  I do not think this is the case anymore - indeed,  rebooting  too  quickly  might cause  loss  of  not-yet-written  data. Note that both the kernel and the disk hardware can buffer data.</p>
<p>  DOS 6.x WARNING<br>
  The DOS 6.x FORMAT command looks for some  information  in the  first  sector  of the data area of the partition, and treats this information as more reliable than the information in the partition table.  DOS FORMAT expects DOS FDISK to clear the first 512 bytes of the data area of a  partition  whenever a size change occurs.  DOS FORMAT will look at this extra information even if the /U flag is given, we consider this a bug in DOS FORMAT and DOS FDISK.<br>
  <br>       
  The  bottom  line  is  that  if you use cfdisk or fdisk to change the size of a DOS partition table entry,  then  you must  also use <a href="dd.html">dd</a> to zero the first 512 bytes of that partition before using DOS FORMAT to  format  the  partition.<br> 
For example, if you were using cfdisk to make a DOS partition table entry for /dev/hda1, then (after exiting  fdisk       
  or  cfdisk and rebooting Linux so that the partition table information is  valid)  you  would  use  the  command  <span class="code">dd if=/dev/zero  of=/dev/hda1  bs=512  count=1</span>  to  zero the       
  first 512 bytes of the partition.<br>
  <br>       
  BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL if you use the <a href="dd.html">dd</a> command,  since  a small typo can make all of the data on your disk useless.<br>
  <br>       
For best results, you should  always  use  an  OS-specific  partition table program.  For example, you should make DOS partitions with the DOS FDISK program and Linux partitions with the Linux fdisk or Linux cfdisk program.</p>
<p>BUGS<br>
There are several *fdisk programs around.  Each has its problems and strengths.   </p>
<p>Try  them in the order <span class="code">cfdisk, fdisk, sfdisk</span>.  (Indeed, <span class="body"><a href="cfdisk.html">cfdisk</a></span>  is  a  beautiful  program that  has  strict  requirements on the partition tables it  accepts, and produces high quality partition  tables.  Use it  if  you can.  </p>
<p>fdisk is a buggy program that does fuzzy things - usually it happens to produce reasonable results.<br>
Its  single  advantage is that it has some support for BSD disk labels and other non-DOS partition tables.  Avoid it if  you can.  sfdisk is for hackers only - the user interface is terrible, but it is more correct  than  fdisk  and more  powerful  than  both fdisk and cfdisk.  Moreover, it can be used noninteractively.)</p>
<p> The IRIX/SGI type disklabel is currently not supported  by the kernel.  Moreover, IRIX/SGI header directories are not fully supported yet.<br>
<br>
The option `dump partition table to file' is missing.</p>
