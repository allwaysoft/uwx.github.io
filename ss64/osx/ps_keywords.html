<pre>     %cpu    The cpu utilization of the process; this is a decaying average
             over up to a minute of previous (real) time.  Since the time base
             over which this is computed varies (since processes can be very
             young) it is possible for the sum of all %CPU fields to exceed 100%.
<pre><code> %mem    The percentage of real memory used by this process.

 flags   The flags associated with the process as in the include file:

   P_ADVLOCK     0x00001     Process might hold a POSIX advisory lock
   P_CONTROLT    0x00002     Has a controlling terminal
   P_INMEM       0x00004     Loaded into memory
   P_NOCLDSTOP   0x00008     No SIGCHLD when children stop
   P_PPWAIT      0x00010     Parent is waiting for child to exec/exit
   P_PROFIL      0x00020     Has started profiling
   P_SELECT      0x00040     Selecting; wakeup/waiting danger
   P_SINTR       0x00080     Sleep is interruptible
   P_SUGID       0x00100     Had set id privileges since last exec
   P_SYSTEM      0x00200     System proc: no sigs, stats or swapping
   P_TIMEOUT     0x00400     Timing out during sleep
   P_TRACED      0x00800     Debugged process being traced
   P_WAITED      0x01000     Debugging process has waited for child
   P_WEXIT       0x02000     Working on exiting
   P_EXEC        0x04000     Process called exec
   P_NOSWAP      0x08000     Another flag to prevent swap out
   P_PHYSIO      0x10000     Doing physical I/O
   P_OWEUPC      0x20000     Owe process an addupc() call at next ast
   P_SWAPPING    0x40000     Process is being swapped

 lim     The soft limit on memory used, specified via a call to
         setrlimit(2).

 lstart  The exact time the command started, using the <code></code>%c'' format
         described in strftime(3).

 nice    The process scheduling increment (see setpriority(2)).

 rss     the real memory (resident set) size of the process (in 1024 byte
         units).

 start   The time the command started.  If the command started less than
   24 hours ago, the start time is displayed using the <code></code>%l:ps.1p''
   format described in strftime(3).  If the command started less
   than 7 days ago, the start time is displayed using the
   <code></code>%a6.15p'' format.  Otherwise, the start time is displayed using
   the <code></code>%e%b%y'' format.

 state   The state is given by a sequence of letters, for example,
         'RWNA''.  The first letter indicates the run state of the process:

   D       Marks a process in disk (or other short term, uninterruptible) wait.
   I       Marks a process that is idle (sleeping for longer than about 20 seconds).
   R       Marks a runnable process.
   S       Marks a process that is sleeping for less than about 20 seconds.
   T       Marks a stopped process.
   Z       Marks a dead process (a <code></code>zombie'').

   Additional characters after these, if any, indicate additional
   state information:

   +       The process is in the foreground process group of its control terminal.
   &amp;lt;       The process has raised CPU scheduling priority.
   &amp;gt;       The process has specified a soft limit on memory requirements and is currently
           exceeding that limit; such a process is (necessarily) not swapped.
   A       the process has asked for random page replacement
           (VA_ANOM, from vadvise(2), for example, lisp(1) in a garbage collect).
   E       The process is trying to exit.
   L       The process has pages locked in core (for example, for raw I/O).
   N       The process has reduced CPU scheduling priority (see setpriority(2)).
   S       The process has asked for FIFO page replacement (VA_SEQL,
           from vadvise(2), for example, a large image processing
           program using virtual memory to sequentially address
           voluminous data).
   s       The process is a session leader.
   V       The process is suspended during a vfork.
   W       The process is swapped out.
   X       The process is being traced or debugged.

 tt        An abbreviation for the pathname of the controlling terminal, if
           any.  The abbreviation consists of the three letters following
           /dev/tty, or, for the console, <code></code>con''.  This is followed by a
           '-' if the process can no longer reach that controlling termi-
           nal (i.e., it has been revoked).

 wchan     The event (an address in the system) on which a process waits.
   When printed numerically, the initial part of the address is
   trimmed off and the result is printed in hex, for example,
   0x80324000 prints as 324000.

 When printing using the command keyword, a process that has exited and
 has a parent that has not yet waited for the process (in other words, a
 zombie) is listed as <code></code>&lt;defunct&gt;'', and a process which is blocked while
 trying to exit is listed as <code></code>&lt;exiting&gt;''.   Ps makes an educated guess as
 to the file name and arguments given when the process was created by
 examining memory or the swap area.   The method is inherently somewhat
 unreliable and in any event a process is entitled to destroy this infor-
 mation, so the names cannot be depended on too much.
 The ucomm (accounting) keyword can, however, be depended on.
