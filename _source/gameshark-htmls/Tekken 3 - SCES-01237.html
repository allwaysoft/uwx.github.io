So you can play, for example, Xiaoyu with Ogre's moves. Replace both of the two "xx"s with the character's moves digits you'd like to have. Using this code, every character you choose will play like the character whose moves you've selected.This code has some drawbacks. These are: 1.) If you Continue in Arcade Mode, your character will revert back to his or her normal moves. As soon as you reach the next stage, however, they will change back to what you've chosen via the code. 2.) If you play more than one match in VS Mode, your moves will revert back to normal. To fix this, simply Soft Reset (Select+Start) after each match you play in VS Mode, then go back into VS Mode.<h2>Motion Capture Change - P2's Motions</h2><code>300A0876 00??<br>300AAA92 00??</code><br>This code allows you to use another character's moves.
