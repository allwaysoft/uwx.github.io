Stage 2 requires that a char of 9.8" or larger be caught, set fish size modifier & catch 1 char to proceed to next level.
Stage 3 requires that 20 bitterling be caught set bitterling modifier to 0014 & catch 1 bitterling to proceed to next level.

Stage 5 requires that 1 bass larger 15" & 1 blue gill larger than 9.1" be caught set fish size modifier & catch one of each.
Stage 6 requires 5 cutthroat trout larger than 9.8" be caught use size modifier, however I haven't found a way around catching 5 fish. Afterall that to proceed to the next set of levels you have to catch & release 100 fish. Catch 1 more fish with the 100 fish code enabled to proceed. These codes work on round 2 also.
