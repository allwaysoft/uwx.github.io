Thus, when the cash is calculated at the end of the mission, it can deduct some for having lost some armour. In order to get around this, put a higher value than 00C8, say 0190, into the code. This will also have the side effect of giving negative damage at the end of the mission for some lighter armoured planes, and hence give you a cash bonus.
