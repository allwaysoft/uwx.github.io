Conditional Execution</h1>
<p>Chain commands to run one after another</p>
<pre>An AND list has the form 

<var>      command1</var> &amp;&amp; <var>command2</var></pre>
<pre><var>command2</var> is executed if, and only if, <var>command1</var> succeeds

An OR list has the form 
<var>
      command3</var> || <var>command4</var>
<var>
command4</var> is executed if, and only if, <var>command3</var> fails  </pre>
<p>In any event the second command must wait for the first command to either complete successfully or to fail. </p>
<p>A <code>list</code> is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one 
  of the operators <samp>`;'</samp>, <samp>`&amp;'</samp>, <samp>`&amp;&amp;'</samp>, 
  or <samp>`||'</samp>, and optionally terminated by one of <samp>`;'</samp>, <samp>`&amp;'</samp>, or a <code>newline</code>. </p>
<p>Of these list operators, <samp>`&amp;&amp;'</samp> and <samp>`||'</samp> have 
  equal precedence, followed by <samp>`;'</samp> and <samp>`&amp;'</samp>, which 
  have equal precedence. </p>
<p>If a command is terminated by the control operator <samp>`&amp;'</samp>, the 
  shell executes the command asynchronously in a subshell. This is known as executing 
  the command in the <var>background</var>. The shell does not wait for the command 
  to finish, and the return status is 0 (true).<br>
  <br>
  When job control is not active, the standard input for asynchronous commands, 
  in the absence of any explicit redirections, is redirected from <code>/dev/null</code>. 
</p>
<p>Commands separated by a <samp>`;'</samp> are executed sequentially; the shell 
  waits for each command to terminate in turn. The return status is the exit status 
  of the last command executed. </p>
<p>The return status of AND and OR lists is the exit status of the last command 
  executed in the list.
